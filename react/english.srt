This is React Podcast, I'm Chantastic. Today
we're going back, way back. Back to the beginning

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,380
of React. 10 years in the rear view mirror
it may feel like React was always going to

5
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,719
succeed. That a framework by Facebook was
too big to fail. But this isn't that kind

6
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,290
of story. In fact there were many times in
React's history where it seemed like it wasn't

7
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:05,610
going to succeed at all. So what happened?
How did react go, in 10 years, from looking

8
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,200
dead on arrival to becoming the dominant front-end
JavaScript framework that it is today.

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,820
It starts at Facebook in 2011. jQuery and backbone
are dominating front-end JavaScript but more

10
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,710
opinionated tools like Ember, Angular and
Knockout are already on the scene. In the

11
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:30,070
outside world, Gangnam Style has just been
uploaded to YouTube, Call Me Maybe is topping

12
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,790
the charts, and the freshest meme is the Overly
Attached Girlfriend. In Internet years it's

13
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,500
basically been an eternity. So strap in, set
yourself away, enable that do not disturb

14
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,320
because this is quite the underdog story.

When I got the offer to work at Facebook,
I told my mom, I was like really excited.

23
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,840
The Social Network the movie had just come
out and she had you know seen it recently

24
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,970
and she was actively discouraging me from
joining because she was like Mark Zuckerberg

25
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,769
doesn't seem like a very nice boy. Facebook
in the time I was there was, I don't think

26
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:59,170
there'll be anything like it ever again. It
was certainly not like anything that I had

27
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,129
experienced before. In fact just a couple
months after I joined Kanye West came to visit

28
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:11,049
Facebook's campus and he got up on a table
in the cafe and you know rapped a few bars

29
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:15,321
and I was working mostly with this guy who
had just graduated from college and I was

30
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:20,299
trying to explain to him you know I've worked
these crap jobs in software, at that point

31
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:26,410
had been like 10 or 15 years, nothing like
this ever happens, not to software engineers.

32
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:32,319
"You're my stressing, you're my masseuse,
mama say mama sa mama dandeson". JavaScript at

33
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,159
the time, I think, was going through this
little bit of an existential crisis as to

34
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:44,189
whether it was like a real programming language
or a toy programming language. And so there

35
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:49,040
was a lot of churn. So you had jQuery was
popular and MooTools was popular and there

36
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,459
was so many different like warring frameworks
to try to get the mind share. And there's

37
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,390
a lot of similarities between them but each
one had its kind of bespoke differences and

38
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,780
none of them were actually really fantastic
for building really kind of complicated user

39
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,220
interfaces and apps. There was this trend
towards more sophisticated applications that

40
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:13,230
do more stuff and at Facebook we still had
a primarily sort of server rendered technology

41
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,299
stack which you know, one of the things that
we fought against for a really long time was

42
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,930
just growing JavaScript bundle sizes so as
we moved more and more stuff to the client,

43
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,370
the client got slower and slower so we actually
swung the pendulum towards server-side rendering

44
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,270
and towards you know minimal amounts of JavaScript
for a while. And there was this feeling that

45
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,590
we knew that what we were doing for client-side
development wasn't working but also that server

46
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:43,770
side wasn't going to get us all the way there.
So I think that was the kind of environment

47
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,720
that React came out of.

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:57,620
[Music]

49
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,260
I joined Facebook back in 2010. I've been
doing a lot of open source work particularly

50
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,229
in the JavaScript world. I was a committer
on the Dojo.js toolkit back in the day, which

51
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:14,210
is one of the the granddaddies of the JavaScript
movement along with prototype and jQuery.

52
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:20,270
I spent my first two years at Facebook on
the mobile team. We had started off a big

53
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:25,289
push to compete with Apple and Google and
we thought that our best chance of success

54
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:32,419
as a company was to go directly to the web
and really push to build out the HTML5 ecosystem.

55
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:38,819
So as part of that we developed, myself and
two other engineers called Vladimir Kolesnikov

56
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:43,970
and Will Bailey, built a framework called
Bolt.js so named because we bolted together

57
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,640
a bunch of things that each of us liked.

58
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,630
Bolt was basically more or less Facebook's implementation 

59
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,699
of a client-side MVC. I think it was like
a pretty good version, maybe a better version,

60
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:01,148
of things like Backbone and a couple of other
Frameworks that had existed at the time.

61
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:08,510
But it was born from a place of the specific constraints
of Facebook. It's the heart of your Facebook

62
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:14,190
experience. Completely rethought from the
ground up. We've been working on it all year

63
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:20,400
and we're calling it Timeline. Facebook was
one of the first big products that was really

64
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,759
an experience more than anything else. You're
not trying to buy groceries or get tickets

65
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,259
or anything like that on Facebook, you really
just want to be entertained. And as such you

66
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:35,960
know the user interface itself needs to be
really pleasing. Bolt was not a tool belt,

67
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:42,389
it was truly an application development framework.
Something designed and meant to build complicated

68
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:48,580
interactive rich apps and was being used to
build pretty complicated very real products

69
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,330
at Facebook at the time. We ended up having
to essentially replicate most of Facebook,

70
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:59,111
all the various apps, be it timeline, chat,
newsfeed. We had a whole photos app that we

71
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:04,440
built and so obviously the team had to expand
greatly. Like that so I think at some point

72
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,270
we probably had maybe 25 engineers working
on all this between building Bolt and building

73
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,420
apps built on Bolt and that's just on the
mobile team. Bolt was never the problem, it

74
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,460
was the architecture that would eventually
break down for us. As the product itself got

75
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,690
more complex and as we added more engineers
to the team, we didn't hit a wall but it started

76
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:28,460
to get really, really hard to make changes.
And so you know that was around the time that

77
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,301
Jordan was on the ads team and he's like I
wonder, there's got to be a better way.

78
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,320
Jordan is an enigmatic figure. He uh he's
a little secretive so there's not much that

79
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,699
I know about him. Jordan and I aren't necessarily..
we haven't necessarily been in the spotlight

80
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,111
much. Especially Jordan kind of shied away
from spotlights since the early days. Jordan

81
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:05,979
was a product engineer at the time, working
on ads and ads has one of the most complicated

82
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:12,830
pieces of UI across all of Facebook at the
moment. On the ads team they were hitting much

83
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,880
you know really hitting the limits of what
you can do without React complexity wise.

84
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,560
And just the developers ability to hold in
their head and understand a bit of code that

85
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,370
somebody else wrote and you know look at the
screen and say okay this code is doing that

86
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,560
and I need to know why. And Jordan had a lot
of very interesting ideas around how you could

87
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,550
take what we had done in Bolt and make it
much more functional and make it more ability..

88
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:41,269
make it easier for it to scale with people's
ability to understand large applications.

89
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:44,990
And so we had a lot of ongoing dialogue and
he would come back and forth to us with various

90
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,720
ideas how to change it. I think one of the
original names for react was FBolt which is

91
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,450
Functional Bolt.

92
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:59,310
He saw that there was an opportunity to do
it.. to solve some of the tricky parts in

93
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:06,500
Bolt in an easier way. So what Jordan decided
to do, or at least the story that he had told

94
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:14,710
me, was: "hey wouldn't it be easier if, any
time anything happened, in the app: API state

95
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,840
changes, user type something, we just blow
away the entire UI and we re-render all of it".

96
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,300
If you look at what every other framework
was doing at the time, it was called two-way

97
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,940
data binding and this was not that. It was
like: forget about data binding we're not

98
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,459
going to do that at all. Anytime anything
changes we're just going to re-render and

99
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,380
then there's an asterisk which says well we're
not going to re-render everything, we're going

100
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,690
to try to render as little as possible but
conceptually we're not going to manage these

101
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,589
relationships between views and models, we're
just gonna.. Honestly I thought it was completely

102
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,880
crazy. At the time I was really down on frameworks
in general and I thought there was no way

103
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,190
that was going to work. To many people that
seemed like magic, it was so far outside of

104
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:05,311
everybody's idea of how things should work
and do work that yeah it took a lot of convincing.

105
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:32,937
[Music]

106
00:10:32,937 --> 00:10:39,240
I've been working at Facebook for 10 years
now. I met this person called Jordan Walke.

107
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,770
Some people told me he had an interesting
project about JavaScript and I may be interested.

108
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:49,149
And so I had this meeting with him and one
thing he asked me at the beginning of the

109
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:57,760
meeting was: what is the most difficult thing
to do in the front-end right now? And I mean,

110
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,230
I was six months out of school, I was like
I don't know and the thing he told me is:

111
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:09,470
updates. You need to find the DOM node that
is going to change, you need to change the

112
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:16,110
listener to the click event and remove it
and do all of this, which is pretty complicated.

113
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,560
And this was also a massive source of bugs
within the Facebook codebase.

114
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,610
I was like, yeah you're right, this is probably the hardest
thing. 

115
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,840
And he was like: I have a solution for this.

116
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,310
I was like, okay this guy is crazy,
like this is never going to work, it's never

117
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:38,800
going to be performant. The meeting ended
and for a few weeks I forgot about the idea.

118
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,450
But one weekend I was like, okay maybe I should
try this, maybe there's something to it.

119
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:53,920
Before joining Facebook, I worked on a way to find
your guild in World of Warcraft and we basically

120
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:01,320
needed to search through like 20.000 guilds.
And I did a lot of performance work to be

121
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,700
the fastest way possible to display when you
change all of those filters in real time.

122
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:12,829
And I was like: okay I spent months, full
time, working on making this super performant,

123
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:19,240
let's try it with React. And in practice it
took me like half an hour to write it and

124
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,130
it was actually not as performant but around
the same order of magnitude at performance.

125
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:30,600
And I was like mind blown and to this day
I became the biggest React fan in the world.

126
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,839
I was in the photos team and spending all
of my working hours like trying to use React

127
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,290
on my own projects in the photos team, evangelizing.
I felt like it could change the world

128
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,211
which it did.

129
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:50,440
[Music]

130
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,880
[Chantastic] Jordan is making headway on his
project. He's gotten others involved and they're

131
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:03,329
seeing the value. But not everyone is impressed.
One manager started to take notice but saw

132
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:09,790
Jordan's project as a distraction. So they
asked Lee Byron to meet with Jordan and put

133
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,600
a stop to it (to focus efforts on Bolt). We
get into a room. Instantly I knew that this

134
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,300
was going to be weird because we showed up
with very different energies. I'm showing

135
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:23,950
up with this like, okay Jordan I want to understand
what's going on with your project but I also

136
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,870
want to help make sure that we are spending
our time well and we're working on things

137
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:33,100
that are gonna have longevity and solving
problems we want to have. And Jordan came

138
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,860
in with like, can I show you a demo of what
I've been working on like this is so exciting

139
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,740
and it does this and it does that. And eventually
like towards the end of this meeting with

140
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,709
him I had to kind of admit like he had something
really compelling. Like I was now really interested

141
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:51,670
in learning more about what he was doing.
So Jordan's pitch to me was like I only want

142
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,810
to invest in this and work on it if it's going
to be something that people will use and if

143
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,199
that's not going to be the case, sure we're
not going to do this. He's like but I feel

144
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,290
really strongly that all the ways we've been
doing UI development up until now have been

145
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,230
flawed. Whether they're a JavaScript library
that doesn't quite work for us or whether

146
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:14,000
it's like a 30 year old tried and true model
for doing UI application development. They

147
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,260
all suffer from the same base problem: a state
management and I think this is the way forward,

148
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:27,759
and Lee if you could just dig into the code
and learn more and try it and then come back

149
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,120
and we'll talk about this again, then we can
figure this out. I was like all right all

150
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:38,690
right and so I did I dug around the code and
it was um a little hard to understand, but

151
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,339
I eventually got to play with it and got to
build a couple of things and had to admit,

152
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:48,060
coming away, that like yes there was something
incredibly interesting there. And that was

153
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,730
how I got sucked into the project and I ended
up working on it quite a bit for the the next couple of months.

154
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,209
Lee brings this rigor and sort of design 
mentality to these things that

155
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,940
really helped with the initial versions of
React in terms of standardizing it and turning

156
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,459
it from something that was kind of like an
ugly baby that had just grown up at Facebook

157
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,918
to something that really people could approach
from around the world.

158
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:12,810
[Music]

159
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:21,000
There were a couple of problems that I faced right away
when trying to understand the code base and

160
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,990
build something. Not only was the the set
of tools and the mental models really different

161
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:35,220
from what I was used to as a UI engineer.
The syntax and the programming concepts involved,

162
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,850
just the terminology, was also really different.
My takeaway was, you know, okay the whole

163
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,790
bid here was that this would be simpler but
I can't help but feel like this is really

164
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:51,790
complicated. Mostly as a desire for me to
understand the model but also with a hope

165
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:58,800
that it would kind of end up helping resolve
some things, I wanted to build a glossary.

166
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:06,300
Like what are all the things the concepts
and then what are all the actions or verbs

167
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,649
that are going on here. And so I literally
just listed them all out. And then I would

168
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:13,610
go back to Jordan, I'd go back to other people
working on it, and ask questions like did

169
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,199
I get this right? Are these definitions right?
And they go yeah okay, no you should really

170
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,380
think about it that way, and be like okay,
well that's not how this.. And it would go

171
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,700
back and forth and back and forth and I'd
be honing these definitions and along the

172
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:30,040
way we'd realize like, oh this concept and
that concept are the same, we're going to

173
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,080
name them one thing instead of two things.
So unwinding all of this and essentially writing

174
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:41,100
up what ended up being like a reimagining
of the component life cycle and therefore

175
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,899
sort of the entire front-facing API for React.
And I was very happy to see like incredible

176
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:50,610
enthusiasm around that. Jordan was like "ah
this is amazing, this really clarifies the

177
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:56,050
ideas". At that point a handful of other folks
had gotten involved with the project too and

178
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:02,060
then I spent sort of the next month or so,
sort of piece by piece folding those into

179
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:08,560
place and pretty significantly changing the
surface API of React in the process. That

180
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,400
was I think the first shift from this being
a thing that existed mostly in Jordan's head,

181
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,630
that other people were playing with, to a
thing that all of a sudden felt owned by the

182
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,280
whole team. Where team here is like a collection
of UI Engineers scattered across Facebook

183
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,270
who were sort of bought in on this vision,
who now felt that we now have the same terminology

184
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,380
we can use when someone has a question, anyone
can jump in and answer it rather than only

185
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,480
Jordan. That was the first big shift.

186
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,080
[Music] 

187
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,320
[Dog snoring] 

188
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:49,410
One of the first projects that React was used
for was the UFI, the Universal Feedback Interface,

189
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,250
which is basically the likes, comments and
shares at the bottom of each post. This was

190
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:59,450
still during Facebook's kind of web era, when
Facebook on the web was like the sort of big

191
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:05,690
driver of engagement. Newsfeed had a billion
people hitting it every day and was massively

192
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:11,030
tuned for performance. Heavily interactive
surface both on the input side of course you're

193
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,090
like clicking it to add likes, you're typing
into it to add comments, but also on the receiving

194
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,970
side we want comments to come in live, so
as you're looking at it as a comment comes

195
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:24,650
in we want it to just pop up right there.
And there was this product desire for that

196
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:31,540
interface to feel almost like a one-off chat
thread, and that was so cool at that time.

197
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,150
And as that started to work the second thread
was well okay if this can work for this really

198
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,710
isolated sense of messaging then what if it
could work for messaging as a whole and this

199
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:47,740
was another really complicated and fraught
with bug surface area. That was when a lot

200
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:54,780
of the ideas in React congealed, the JSX syntax
was introduced and some of the ideas about

201
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:00,000
how to work with data and React sort of were
clarified. A couple of our UI Engineers, along

202
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,280
with the messaging team, if I remember correctly
Jing Chen was sort of the champion of this

203
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,960
project, realized that we needed a completely
new way to think about state too.

204
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,320
[People clapping]

205
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,669
So my name is Jing and I'm a software engineer
in the product infrastructure team at Facebook.

206
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:23,520
[Chantastic] Flux is an application architecture designed
around React's principle of unidirectional

207
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,250
data flow. Paired with Flux, React could go
beyond the view layer to model entire applications.

208
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,700
This shift in how to think about state paired
very well with how React was thinking about

209
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,860
updating UI and ended up being sort of the
next chapter for how to think about React

210
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:46,909
being more than just how do you model complicated
UI but how do you model sufficiently complicated

211
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:50,340
applications. Like this was something that
expanded the full screen and multiple touch

212
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,240
points and had navigation to it and it allowed
us to step into that next chapter. I remember

213
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,419
asking Jing like hey how's it going with this
React stuff? Do you think this is going to

214
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:04,340
work? She was like, yeah this is pretty good,
I'm pretty sure it's gonna work. That was

215
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,702
when I became more convinced.

216
00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:21,830
[Music]

217
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:27,530
Instagram joined Facebook in 2012. I think
we had started calling it React by then and

218
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:32,330
there was a couple of engineers from Facebook
that went to join Instagram to help them expand

219
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,860
the product offering. At the time Instagram
was just an iOS and an Android app and they

220
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,100
wanted to have a web presence as well.

221
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,980
[Music]

222
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,986
I spent 11 years in San Francisco, it was really fun

223
00:20:49,986 --> 00:20:56,600
I made a lot of great friends
but the change of pace out in the countryside is great.

224
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,800
It's just very peaceful
and nice.

225
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:00,680
I went to Facebook straight out of school.

226
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,780
I studied computer science undergrad
and I got a master's degree. Facebook was,

227
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:12,750
believe it or not, the cool place to work
back in 2010. It was this great product, that

228
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:18,420
everybody used. It was super cool on college
campuses and I was really excited to work there.

229
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,350
[Music]

230
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:30,000
I joined Facebook video. The pitch was, we're
the third largest video site in the world,

231
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,280
after YouTube and Dailymotion I think, and
there was like one engineer working on it

232
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,970
and like you get to be engineer number two
and I was like that sounds pretty cool. We

233
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,861
worked really closely with the iOS photos
team in the Android Photos team and we were

234
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:47,609
building an Instagram killer and nobody remembers
this but it was called Facebook Camera.

235
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:54,410
One morning the photo's team got called into the
office early. They said like be at HQ at 8am

236
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,789
and then the VP of engineering was like hey
we bought Instagram, they're your new co-workers now.

237
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:02,980
And these were like the people that were
like our fierce competitors you know. We looked

238
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,200
at them a little bit as the enemy, I'm sure
they looked at us a little bit as the enemy.

239
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,950
They were a really small team at the time,
they had their core fundamentals really nailed

240
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,370
but there was a lot of stuff they needed to
figure out, that they did not have the team

241
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,730
to figure out on their own and a big one of
those was what does it mean for Instagram

242
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:23,140
to be on the web. The web experience is really
important for driving growth and so this was

243
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,100
a pretty important priority and so me and
this designer, Maykel Loomans, started building

244
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:34,370
all the web stuff. And that's kind of where
React enters the picture, when we started

245
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,408
developing this website.

246
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:42,407
[Music]

247
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:49,270
We were given this mandate to use client rendering
so I went to the product infrastructure team

248
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:56,830
at Facebook, which was run by Tom Occhino.
Product infrastructure's role was to support

249
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:03,830
any team that needed help and do it in a way
that your key indicators of success are going

250
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,380
to be other teams saying "yeah that really
helped us". You go to them and you kind of

251
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:15,060
consult the Council of Elders and they give
you their recommendation and I said, hey we

252
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,900
need to do client rendering, what do we do?
And the recommendation at the time was yeah

253
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,420
we don't know. We've got like three different
things that we're working on, you should go

254
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:33,809
try one. We had something called Bolt.js,
there was a second thing called JS.HTML and

255
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:36,554
then there was this this thing called React.

256
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:39,850
Pete went and spoke to Jordan about using

257
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,620
React and he came and talked to me about potentially
using Bolt for it but I think he really, really

258
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:50,559
liked Jordan's ideas around functional programming.
The conceptual model of react was like crazy

259
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,830
innovative and it really, really spoke to
me. My background was in distributed systems.

260
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:01,610
I was not somebody that loved front-end or
thought front-end was doing things well, so

261
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:06,070
the fact that React came in with like a totally
fresh approach and didn't really care too

262
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:11,070
much about existing best practices, like I
was I was on board with that. So while I had

263
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:16,289
evaluated all three I really just dove in
on React to build a prototype first and that

264
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:22,870
ended up shipping on Instagram.com which was
the second use of React in production ever

265
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:30,590
and the first use of building a full application
end to end in React.

266
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,979
When I chose React for Instagram it was not
well known within Facebook and it was this

267
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:37,000
kind of crazy science experiment.

268
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:45,520
Not even close. By the time Instagram was,
and you know Pete started playing with it,

269
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,909
it was significantly better than it was in
the early, early stage but it still needed

270
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:55,200
a ton of iteration. We had to take this thing
that was very much tied to Facebook's infrastructure

271
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,720
which back then was a big giant PHP application
and I had to go get that working in a Django

272
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,440
application which is a totally different system.
And what was key was not doing that once but

273
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,049
making that a repeatable process and making
sure that that pipeline didn't break. I think

274
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:17,059
he hit a number of really interesting problems
along the way which quite proved the fact

275
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:22,130
that React was not quite ready for that scale
and along the way Pete, and the team that

276
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,980
he was working with, built a lot of really
interesting things.

277
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:35,524
[Music]

278
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,190
Some of these products ended up being fairly
successful. There were relatively short time

279
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:03,800
to deliver a relatively high quality product.
That showed that this model could work and

280
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:10,010
it was not just that, but people liked developing
using it. And so that kind of spread and took

281
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:15,510
off and especially is it got more and more
investment, it became clear that this was

282
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:22,110
what we wanted to use and it was really ads
that was kind of using Bolt more. It had a

283
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:28,230
higher level of investment, more people working
in that code base, that already knew it and

284
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,930
more components so it was a harder shift to
make.

285
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:40,340
The ads team just before I joined ads from
the mobile team had done a full rewrite of

286
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,820
the ads creation flow into Bolt. Which took
them I think upwards of six months replacing

287
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:52,340
a very old PHP application with what time
was considered a very modern JavaScript application.

288
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:58,679
But at the same time React was also now actually
deployed for real on Facebook and had a team

289
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:03,000
that was forming around it. So we now had
two viable frameworks that were both live

290
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,360
on Facebook, both solving real problems. We
shouldn't have two. Especially two that were

291
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,919
similar. Similar enough to confuse people.
Like if you looked at the code, their code

292
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,029
almost looked identical but that worked really
differently. It would actually be an absolute

293
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:22,420
nightmare if you had to work in both. So we
had to decide which to use.

294
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,890
[Music]

295
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,580
A lot of this ended up being a conversation
between myself and Jordan. We did an evaluation

296
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:36,660
of both of them. A lot of performance-based
stuff and trying to figure out where the edge

297
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:42,030
cases were. On the pro side of React, obviously
there's all the things that we know now: it

298
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,890
handles complexity way, way more. Even when
writing the ads creation flow in Bolt we had

299
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,760
already hit one place that you just could
not do in Bolt without writing spaghetti code,

300
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,940
and you can do in React. So we knew in the
future even if it was only 10% of the experience

301
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,230
we were building, we're going to run into
this problem again. Now it might only be 10%

302
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,169
unmaintainable but as you scale that across
a company that is growing rapidly, this becomes

303
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:10,140
an absolute mess. The cons of it on the other
hand were that React in a lot of ways was

304
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,860
not battle tested yet. There's a lot of things
that simply didn't work in React. It couldn't

305
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,970
handle forms, they'd never done a text box
and there's a lot of complexities around handing

306
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,610
awkward form controls like radio buttons and
so on that it messed up. Just performance

307
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,679
issues where it would try and re-render large
blocks so they hadn't had to do all of the

308
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,830
performance improvements that obviously exist
now. On the organizational side the other

309
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:39,590
con was that we had just done the six-month
rewrite in Bolt. Facebook had done an IPO

310
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:45,750
recently and the stock had halved since IPO.
Facebook wasn't making enough money and so

311
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:49,870
the ads team is the team that makes, you know,
that's where the money starts. If we stop

312
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:55,679
for four months we're gonna have to tell everybody
sorry no money for you so there was a lot

313
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,150
of conversation back and forth about all this.
It got very difficult. Initially a lot of

314
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:03,620
the engineers that used Bolt, including Shane,
realized just what you said. Like look we've

315
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,760
invested so much in this thing and it's really
worked for all this stuff, certainly we can

316
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,100
work through the next set of challenges we're
having. So initially there was opposition

317
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,299
to React coming in and saying like how are
you gonna, you know, this new thing that's

318
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:20,750
not even proven yet. This is our business,
this is really important. When Jordan and

319
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:25,890
I were working through it, there was definitely
uh some emotions uh there um and mostly I

320
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,640
think it came from uh each of us having a
lack of context of where the other one was

321
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,510
coming from. So I think there was a lot of
talking past each other. In the end Mike Schroepfer

322
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:41,360
stepped in and said, look make the right technical
decision, make the right long-term decision

323
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,159
and whatever it is I'll back you up. But if
you need to pause product development for

324
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:53,070
four months you can. We all kind of just got
in rooms and you know worked through all these

325
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:57,320
things and got everything out in the air of
what's a technical problem, what's an organization

326
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:03,390
problem, what's a financial problem and kind
of a came to the understanding eventually

327
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:09,220
through uh with lots and lots of coffee that
React was the right way to go, but um it was

328
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,420
not a straight line at all.

329
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,799
He ultimately was one of the biggest proponents or decision

330
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:21,330
makers in ads switching everything over to
React and that doesn't happen in most companies.

331
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:27,289
In most companies if that's your baby project
you try to undermine the other, the upstart,

332
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:31,860
because you're you know you're really defensive
over your own thing. That was not the vibe

333
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:37,705
at Facebook at the time and I think that Shane
in particular really exemplified that.

334
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:45,070
There was still a lot of work to do on the ads creation
flow. Tensions were mounting and the team

335
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:50,232
was stuck. Here again to get them unstuck,
is Jing Chen.

336
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:54,271
We'd have this thorny management issue and a lot of people disagreeing with each other,

337
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:55,660
up and down the management chain

338
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,960
on both sides of you know in ads and in this
product infrastructure group, that was building

339
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,130
React, and we'd send Jing in to talk to the engineers and everyone would come out, like

340
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:08,539
patting each other on the back, full agreement,
a plan to move forward. So she's great at

341
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:14,430
building a consensus because she's able to
drill into the important technical details,

342
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:18,520
identify them really quickly and get everyone
talking about the same thing. She obviously

343
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,330
helped both build the product but she also
made sure that every time we found a bug in

344
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:28,380
React or just something that it didn't handle
yet, she either stepped back from product

345
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,269
and then just fixed the framework. Or she
went back to the team and said look we need

346
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:36,340
two or three engineers working on this stuff
for the next month to unblock the ads team.

347
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,580
The ads manager was complicated enough that
it actually ended up being a really great

348
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:48,020
source of performance improvements and finding
like, where are the true points where it just

349
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:53,039
doesn't quite scale. So I think it was a lot
of using the building blocks that we had and

350
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,110
as you start to assemble them into a really
complicated looking application, what are

351
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,410
the new problems that come out of that, that
we need to solve. And there was definitely

352
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:04,500
a lot of those. This is one of the most fun
intense periods of my career as I remember

353
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,289
it. We would be going to meet with the team
and we would have to help them put some feature

354
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:14,380
in and we would code it up ourselves first
in React just to make sure that the that they

355
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,740
wouldn't hit any rough edges. Or more like
to find all the rough edges that we knew they'd

356
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:24,100
hit and figure out what the solutions would
be. So it was really exciting because we were

357
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,279
working on two things at the same time. One
was delivering this really complicated, really

358
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:33,110
important software project for Facebook: the
ads manager. And the other was refining this

359
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:40,330
framework that we really believed in which
was React. By the time we had rebuilt the

360
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:44,460
ads creation flow, which I think took about
four months, it had been battle tested with

361
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,880
basically everything about the browser supports,
all the form fields and everything, and also

362
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,950
massive performance issues that had been resolved,
so at that point it was kind of felt that

363
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:01,710
it was ready to be open sourced because you
know we we used it in multiple different types

364
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:06,821
of contexts and that you know it would actually
be generally useful to the public.

365
00:33:06,821 --> 00:33:17,634
[Music]

366
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:20,666
[Mumbled question]
What did you say, Evan?

367
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:25,680
Uh there is not, sorry.

368
00:33:26,186 --> 00:33:29,348
Open sourcing React was never 
a question for me. That was the

369
00:33:29,348 --> 00:33:35,370
goal from the very beginning. Tom had this
idea, he called it project perception, and

370
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:40,580
he was really angry I think it's probably
the best word for it. He was angry that Facebook

371
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:46,001
was hiring all these luminaries from the JavaScript
world. They would come to Facebook and

372
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:50,360
because we discouraged people from writing
client-side JavaScript and because it was

373
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,900
a hard environment to maneuver in, they would
actually go pick up mobile because that was

374
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,970
where a lot of the interesting client-side
development was happening. And Tom was determined

375
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:05,389
to change this around. I remember going to
this conference and I was talking to someone

376
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:09,169
and I told them I worked at Facebook on JavaScript
and they're like why would you do that? I

377
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:13,040
hate what Facebook does to the JavaScript
industry. You have hired all these really

378
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,050
great people from these really great projects
and we have no idea what they're working on

379
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:23,159
now. They've given nothing back. So I think
when React came along I started very early

380
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,770
on talking about if this thing works for us
I really want us to find a path to open source.

381
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,859
And I was running that up the management chain
very early so when the time came to open source

382
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:40,520
it, there were some meetings, it was controversial
but we had all the support we needed already.

383
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:52,220
The process of open sourcing is interesting.
There's first a technical problem to solve.

384
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,609
You have to figure out how to extract it out
of your infrastructure and make it work in

385
00:34:55,609 --> 00:35:01,180
the open source, which is all the homework
that we did for Instagram. We made this call

386
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,849
that like we will not impact developer productivity
at all, it's going to be entirely on the open

387
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:10,660
source team, which was just a bunch of people
that wanted to open source it, to make it

388
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:17,120
work. Then actually pulling the trigger on
open source, we had to write a lot of documentation.

389
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,710
We spent actually a lot of time with the documentation
to explain like, hey what is React, what are

390
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:27,170
all the concepts and we tried to put ourselves
in the shoes of somebody that want to build

391
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:33,220
an app. How do we give the documentation in
a way it helps them do that. Paul O'Shannessy

392
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,630
did a lot of this because he really had the
experience with what the ecosystem needed

393
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:46,240
to make this work at the time. Paul O'Shannessy
was a huge force on open sourcing. As was

394
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,770
James Pearce who was the head of Facebook
open source. James had joined the company

395
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:57,720
and he really wanted to change Facebook's
open source image. We had previously open

396
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,080
sourced a lot of stuff but we let it rot.
We would say, hey we're an open source company,

397
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,160
here's our great framework and then we would
just never maintain it. And James and Paul

398
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,970
in particular were pretty instrumental in
saying, hey if we're going to open source

399
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:15,990
React, we're going to do it right. Internally
there was a lot of excitement because we had

400
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:21,409
already been using this thing for a while and it 
was working for us, we were excited about it. 

401
00:36:21,853 --> 00:36:27,450
We chose JSconf US which was kind
of the, I don't know, the Oscars of JavaScript

402
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:31,750
- is that fair representation maybe? You know
all the celebrities are there and everyone's

403
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:36,340
paying attention and everybody watches it
live on YouTube. Tom and Jordan put together

404
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,490
this presentation. Tom is a great speaker
and Jordan is a brilliant engineer, it was

405
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,720
like a Lennon and McCartney type of situation.

406
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,720
There was no way that this thing could possibly fail.

407
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,684
[Music]

408
00:36:54,684 --> 00:37:00,669
It was in Florida, at like 9 00 a.m.
We were in Menlo Park and we woke up early,

409
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:05,050
we took the first bus into the office. It
was completely empty and we're getting ready

410
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:09,241
to like press the button on the repo to open
source it. Jordan and I were all excited we

411
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:13,140
got up on stage. I'm going to talk a bit about
how we do JavaScript application development

412
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,560
at Facebook. It was a little unconventional,
I did a little bit of it, he did more of it.

413
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:23,750
So along with react we are shipping an embeddable
XML syntax and we're calling that JSX. And

414
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:29,301
we jumped into showing some code and that
code looked different, it looked weird. Here

415
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:36,120
we have React used with JSX. And people were
rightfully skeptical we'll call it.

416
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,935
Everyone hated it, everyone thought it was awful!

417
00:37:39,935 --> 00:37:47,492
[Music]

418
00:37:47,492 --> 00:37:53,080
Internally we were expecting a much better
reception. Or at least an "oh that's interesting

419
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,500
reception". We thought there'd be some language
nerds in there who would think "oh I can

420
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,020
do fully functional programming in the UI,
oh at least that's interesting". It was a

421
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,260
really humbling experience, it was kind of
a letdown for us because we had worked nights

422
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:09,314
and weekends on getting this thing open sourceable
and then when we go to launch it, everyone

423
00:38:09,314 --> 00:38:13,360
hated it. The thing that everyone focuses
on is that people really hated JSX.

424
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:20,514
I haven't watched this video in a while.

425
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:30,720
See these divs are not exactly what you're
used to they're not DOM nodes, they're special

426
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,620
reactives and I'll get to why that's important.
I don't remember thinking that they were hating

427
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:42,962
it. I don't remember at all thinking that
they were like tweeting a bunch of stuff.

428
00:38:42,962 --> 00:38:46,650
This is the slide for sure. We haven't talked
about any problems we're trying to solve,

429
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,630
we haven't talked about why this is working
for us or what were the principles of design.

430
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:56,849
We're just like boom here's some XML in your
JavaScript and people are like hey what is

431
00:38:56,849 --> 00:38:58,791
happening. Uh poor Jordan..

432
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,000
What we didn't really fully understand
was how big of a delta

433
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,560
there was between where the rest of the world
was in the JavaScript community and where

434
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:13,060
Facebook was. I don't blame them. I don't
think anybody who tweeted Facebook is crazy

435
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:18,070
was crazy themselves. I think they were kind
of right, we were a little crazy.

436
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:25,589
I think there was a moment for me personally where
I felt like, you know, my goal with the open

437
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:30,740
sourcing of this was to get us closer to the
community and I may have set us back a step.

438
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:35,430
I may have demonstrated that we actually have
no idea what we're doing because what we're

439
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:39,295
doing is so much different than what the rest
of the community was doing. And internally

440
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:45,280
there was a "well we messed that up". We made
the wrong call.

441
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,389
Because I think the measure

442
00:39:47,389 --> 00:39:51,950
of success would have been "wow Facebook engineering
is doing some really cool stuff" and instead

443
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:54,401
it was "Facebook engineering has no idea what
they're doing".

444
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:57,940
I think that JSconf appearance

445
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,480
might have been Jordan's last conference for
a good few years. I think Tom Occhino also

446
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,650
didn't go back for a while as well. It turned
into a bit of a troll fest for no good reason.

447
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:12,589
And particularly for something that was as
innovative and useful and you know just fantastic

448
00:40:12,589 --> 00:40:16,319
for developer productivity and just, it's
literally a gift to everybody. Here, move

449
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,160
faster for free. To have people misunderstand
it and say all these bad things about it,

450
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,960
that were just you know knee-jerk reactions
without actually having taken time to think

451
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,130
about it, can only.. Must have felt very bad.
Especially because both Jordan and Tom had

452
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,600
already gone through all this internally in
Facebook for two years. But inside in Facebook

453
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,930
it's a smaller scale you can just get in a
meeting room and talk about it but you can't

454
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:41,690
really do that with the whole world can you.
There were some technical decisions that were

455
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:49,230
made as part of React that were self-evident
within Facebook but were like crazy when given

456
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:53,550
to a different audience in the community.
There was this notion of separation of concerns.

457
00:40:53,550 --> 00:41:01,700
At the time you shouldn't put your HTML, CSS
and JavaScript into the same file. You should

458
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,550
really extract them out and you should have
this separation. And so this was like very

459
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:12,620
like the best practice at the time. What was
interesting about the approach to separation

460
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,810
of concerns in React is that you separate
your concerns into different components. So

461
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:22,060
rather than saying: I have my view concerns
over here and my model concerns over here,

462
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,910
you say you have your newsfeed concerns over
here, your photo concerns over here, your

463
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:31,040
admin panel concerns over here. So it's a
different way of separating concerns and so

464
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,750
there was a lot of backlash around like oh
those people at Facebook are clowns, they

465
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:40,330
don't know how to write software. We thought
that React probably had no future outside

466
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:40,974
of Facebook.

467
00:41:40,974 --> 00:41:52,362
[Music]

468
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:59,000
It looked like all hope was lost for our friends
at the Facebook office. But fortunately someone

469
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,444
outside of Facebook was willing to give it
a chance.

470
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:11,520
[Music]

471
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,069
When I first started using React in 2013, it was not
popular in the community. It had just been

472
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,313
announced at JSconf.

473
00:42:20,924 --> 00:42:27,273
I saw the announcement
post on Hacker News and immediately thought

474
00:42:27,273 --> 00:42:32,578
that it would be helpful for one of the projects
that I was working on at the time. I was building

475
00:42:32,578 --> 00:42:38,498
an interactive math question editor at Khan
Academy and it was something that had a very

476
00:42:38,498 --> 00:42:44,998
component oriented architecture. I was trying
to use Backbone.js at the time and found that

477
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:49,578
the state management was getting a little
bit hard and when I looked at React I thought

478
00:42:49,578 --> 00:42:55,338
to myself, wow this actually looks like it
solves a lot of the problems that I have right now.

479
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:05,380
I'm looking at this post from 2013 that I
guess I wrote a week after I learned about

480
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:13,339
React and it was right after I had started
trying to use it and somebody had asked "how

481
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:20,948
is Facebook's React JavaScript library". And
I was a few days into using it and so I decided

482
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:25,337
to write an answer to that question based
on my experience.

483
00:43:27,336 --> 00:43:30,000
The answer I wrote is very

484
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,810
positive. I think I was having a really good
time using it and it was solving my needs

485
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:43,240
really well. One line from the post says,
I just rewrote a 2000 line project in React

486
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,609
and have now made a handful of pull requests
to React. Everything about React I've seen

487
00:43:47,609 --> 00:43:53,040
so far seems really well thought out and I
am proud to be the first non-facebook production

488
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,750
user of React. And I talked a little bit more
about some of the technical details and how

489
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:05,200
it was helping me. It's cool to look back
and it's almost a bit of a time capsule to

490
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:14,530
see how even one week into React being released,
I was already pretty excited about it and

491
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:20,079
I think that excitement lasted for a long
time. I converted my entire code base that

492
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,920
I was working on at the time over to React.
I think it ended up being less code and it

493
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,460
was easier to understand and it was faster.
Pretty quickly I said "okay I want to keep

494
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:38,170
using React" and I ended up deploying that
to production, my rewritten code, and that

495
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:42,987
was I think the first production code using
React outside of Facebook.

496
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:53,246
It was a brand new project that had just been
open sourced and not many people had used

497
00:44:53,246 --> 00:44:58,286
it before, and so there were a bunch of rough
edges. It seemed like maybe nobody had tried

498
00:44:58,286 --> 00:45:02,847
to use it in a particular way before. Or if
something just wasn't documented well enough

499
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:07,657
and I was trying to use it a slightly different
way than it was intended I ran into these

500
00:45:07,657 --> 00:45:13,647
little bugs or issues where it didn't work
quite as I was expecting it to. For some of

501
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:18,847
those I read through the source code and tried
to figure out: okay why isn't this working,

502
00:45:18,847 --> 00:45:26,107
is there anything that I can be doing differently
for other cases? I ended up joining the IRC

503
00:45:26,107 --> 00:45:32,327
chat channel where a lot of the core team
members were hanging out after it had been

504
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:40,048
open sourced. They helped me get started not
just using React but also starting to contribute

505
00:45:40,048 --> 00:45:45,537
to it as I started filing issues and helping
other people who were in that chat room, as

506
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:51,928
well as starting to make small code changes
and starting to improve React over time.

507
00:45:52,428 --> 00:45:59,559
Her perspective from Khan Academy and just being
outside of Facebook was so valuable, so helpful!

508
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:05,280
Sophie started as someone using React externally
then sort of like moved on to being someone

509
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,069
who contributed to React core externally then
became the most significant contributor to

510
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:17,119
React core then we would have these like weekly
team meetings and invite Sophie to come and

511
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,410
so Sophie like worked out with her local manager
at her company to like carve out Friday afternoons

512
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:28,700
to come to Facebook and hang out with us.
And so determined not to do what we had done

513
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:34,001
previously where we hired folks from the open
source community and then they never contributed

514
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:42,063
anything back, she became the first ever open
source recruited member of the team.

515
00:46:44,174 --> 00:46:48,940
Sophie's involvement lifted the spirits of
the React team. It also got them thinking

516
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:56,930
that maybe, just maybe, the rest of the ecosystem
had dismissed React unfairly. They had something

517
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:02,419
special, they knew it. What they didn't know
was how to convince everyone else.

518
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:10,869
I think there are people on the team like me and Jordan
and Tom and Chedeau who like the challenge

519
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:17,390
and the competitive nature of it. We knew
that this was good technology and I was so

520
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:25,450
sure of that, I viewed it as just a a messaging
problem, you know, okay we gotta crack how

521
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:30,000
we message this to people because they don't
get it and we have to figure out how to bring them there.

522
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,790
The open source feels like a milestone
and it feels like this is the end. But in

523
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:39,760
practice it is just the beginning. Because
when you open source you actually have zero

524
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,320
users, now you need to actually build a community,
get all of the bugs fixed, make sure it actually

525
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:50,980
solves the use case for the people. And so
this is like when the journey begins. We buckled

526
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:58,190
down. And we also realized I think that really
when you have a project like this that's um

527
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:03,978
different you have to convince people one
by one. So I think that's really what we focused on.

528
00:48:04,422 --> 00:48:10,859
And we learned a lot doing that. We learned
that the ideas in React are solid, but really

529
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:14,790
the ideas are not what people encounter when
they adopt a framework. What they encounter

530
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:20,280
are the docs and the error messages. What
they need more than anything else when they

531
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,138
adopt something is an incremental way of doing that.

532
00:48:23,747 --> 00:48:26,030
So the team got to work. They focused

533
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:31,120
on spreading the knowledge of React one concept
at a time, one person at a time.

534
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,065
Then an opportunity arose: another conference.

535
00:48:35,962 --> 00:48:41,560
Later the same year, thank goodness, 
Pete gave a talk at JSconf EU.

536
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:46,020
I had my desk over by the product
infrastructure team. I was sitting next to

537
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:53,280
Tomo and he's like, oh we're just like sponsoring
this JSconf EU conference and we have to give

538
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,970
a keynote and I don't want to give it. Because
I think he was like he didn't want to go through

539
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,470
all that stuff. Because you know after you
give the talk like people go and yell at you

540
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:06,359
after you get off stage and when you go to
the happy hour and stuff. It's not the most

541
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:11,109
pleasant thing in the world. And I was like,
I'll do it! I'll take the free trip to Berlin

542
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:16,970
and go give a talk at a conference. Hey I'm
Pete, I'm gonna talk to you about a library

543
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:23,630
for creating user interfaces that we call
React. We open sourced this at JSconf US a

544
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:28,880
couple months ago. And we got some kind of
sarcastic responses on Twitter, a little bit

545
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,930
of snickering, that kind of thing. We weren't
really communicating what we were doing so

546
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:39,980
I'd like to talk to you today about the design
decisions around React, what we're doing differently

547
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:45,404
than other Frameworks and kind of the implementation
that lets us make these decisions and make them really fast.

548
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,079
For this talk it was like,
here's what makes React different. 

549
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:52,839
I'm not even trying to say it's good, I'm not even
trying to say you should use it, I'm trying

550
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:56,780
to say that this is interesting and there's
a lot of interesting stuff about how this

551
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:03,319
thing works that you should pay attention
to. And that really resonated with people.

552
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:07,350
And so we got these kind of early innovators
you know if you think of the crossing the

553
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:13,150
chasm diagram, where you've got your your
early adopters and then you've got your laggards

554
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:17,700
and in the middle you have your kind of normal
companies. That talk really got those early

555
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:23,160
adopters fired up and evangelizing React inside
of their own companies. After Pete's talk,

556
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,311
interest started to pick up. People started
paying attention. They just wanted to, you

557
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:31,530
know, let me just see if there's something
there. And so we got this kind of like slow

558
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:36,230
burn of adoption of React. And it prompted
some really interesting conversations. It

559
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:41,230
recruited Brandon Bloom into the community
who came from the functional programming world,

560
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:46,870
somewhere. He started talking to his friends
and said, hey I think this React thing is

561
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:51,099
actually worth paying attention to. And then
he goes and talks to his friend David Nolen

562
00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:58,150
who is this very well known, very well respected,
really great musician and JavaScript developer.

563
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:03,040
I think he was working at the New York Times
at the time and I was passing through New

564
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:10,710
York to do something and we grabbed coffee.
And I asked Pete some questions and Brandon

565
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:16,890
Bloom, that was my friend that said you should
really look at React. And the reason I was

566
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:21,160
excited about it, more than I think you could
have been if you were JavaScript developer,

567
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,119
JavaScript is kind of multi-paradigm you can
do object oriented you can do functional if

568
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:31,980
you want but it's not required but in Clojure
and ClojureScript functional is the most idiomatic

569
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:37,349
thing and nothing existed. Like we were sort
of like always trying to get things to work

570
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:39,110
but it always felt like there was friction.

571
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,730
I was still early in my career right and this

572
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:48,040
is like really senior super smart engineer
and it was the type of thing where he would

573
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:53,109
ask me questions about it and I would stumble
to explain it and I would explain it poorly

574
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:58,930
and then he would repeat it back to me in
like a super eloquent great way and I was

575
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:04,520
like yes, I'm gonna steal that! And so when
I sat with Brandon and Pete it was like this

576
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:11,430
huge light bulb went off, I was like: finally
this is so random, Facebook made this functional

577
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:18,700
UI framework. Eureka! I mean it was definitely
a eureka moment. It it did allow ClojureScript

578
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:25,020
programmers to finally write a reasonably
performant functional UIs. And it was very

579
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,467
natural, it was a very, very good fit.

580
00:52:27,467 --> 00:52:29,435
Like a week or two later he wrote this blog post

581
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:34,363
called the Future of JavaScript MVCs that
just like changed the trajectory of the project.

582
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:39,849
In many ways you look at React and you're
like there's no way this could be fast, there's

583
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:46,122
no way it could be efficient. And then I showed
these diagrams of what Backbone and React/Om

584
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:52,119
look like and React is much better. Especially
when you're using persistent data structures.

585
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:59,570
So my article I think was focusing purely
on the technical benefits of the design. It

586
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:05,109
removed the superficial consideration and
I think people started saying, okay I will

587
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:12,109
try it. Not I'm going to use it but it removed
that "I'm never going to use that" to "oh

588
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:17,660
I'll give it a shot, this is interesting".
Once that post came out like within three

589
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,690
months after that I would say that we were
one of the big contenders if you were picking

590
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:22,830
a JavaScript framework.

591
00:53:23,386 --> 00:53:25,294
If you want to spread
an idea you need to really convince a few

592
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:31,731
people and have those people share your message,
you can't just be shouting it yourself.

593
00:53:31,731 --> 00:53:40,750
More people started to realize that React had some
good ideas and made UI development simpler

594
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:47,010
in a lot of ways. Over the course of the next
I would say like year or two, we're kind of

595
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:53,070
just tracking things like Google Alerts of
how many times is it being mentioned, who's

596
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:58,420
writing about it, what projects are cropping
up. Because React was very unopinionated about

597
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:04,559
a lot of stuff that you need in order to build
a front-end web application and you know people

598
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,790
would fill in the blanks. And there was a
bunch of state management libraries that cropped

599
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:13,590
up and there was a bunch of router libraries
that cropped up and server-side rendering

600
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:18,836
strategies. And so there was this sort of
slow burn of adoption over the next year or two.

601
00:54:18,836 --> 00:54:24,040
React is a small focused UI library but
it proved capable when tackling Facebook's

602
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:30,840
hardest problems and other big companies noticed.
But there was one company especially eager

603
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,546
to rethink best practices.

604
00:54:33,546 --> 00:54:46,880
[Music]

605
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,729
We first heard about React back in 2014. The
Netflix website had been built using Java Web.

606
00:54:51,729 --> 00:54:57,380
It was very slow, it took about 15 minutes
to get up a build and we decided to move to

607
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:03,160
a more modern framework. There we go. Now
at the time we weren't quite sure if you know

608
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,240
this React thing was going to work out. It
was kind of new and so we were very apprehensive,

609
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:12,530
especially since we were building the future
of the next 10 years of the website, right,

610
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:18,030
we make a bad choice now we got to backtrack
years worth of work. And so we were very careful

611
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:22,670
about not jumping into something that was
too bleeding edge. And so what they did was

612
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:26,869
they actually pitted two teams against each
other. Each was given 30 days to build a prototype

613
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:31,986
with one being React and the other one being
Backbone and after 30 days the choice was clear.

614
00:55:34,819 --> 00:55:37,950
So thank you all for coming out tonight. We're
really excited to have you here and share

615
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:42,220
the learnings that we've had, building the
new UI in React for the past year. It was

616
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:46,580
not this stage, it was our next stage over,
where I gave my React presentation back I

617
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:53,220
guess in 2015. Same feeling like oh my goodness
I've got to convince all these people that

618
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,890
React is amazing.

619
00:55:56,890 --> 00:56:01,390
But I guess it worked. So I was part of the
team that built the new site using React.

620
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:05,820
At first it was very clunky, like you're writing
components and they're not quite, you know,

621
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:10,450
you're putting too much logic into them or
you're thinking too big. It's not clear the

622
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:14,100
difference in the paradigm. And then you start
to use it and you go okay wait wait wait I'm

623
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:19,579
thinking much more atomic. Hence the symbol
of react. I'm thinking about this individual

624
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:23,450
reusability, okay now I'm thinking about the
testability of these components, I'm seeing

625
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:27,830
the benefits now come out of it. I can reuse
this over here, we can test this over here,

626
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:32,460
we can change this here, we can add props
in here. And it becomes very exciting to see

627
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:37,120
that new paradigm come to play and go: this
is going to be revolutionary, this is going

628
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:41,180
to change the world. Let's go back in time
one year to the old Netflix UI, you guys might

629
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:45,690
remember this one. The overall look and feel
is kind of like this old DVD kind of box art

630
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:49,850
feel and so I actually want to show you one
of the early prototypes of what we thought

631
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:55,960
the new UI would look like. We knew that going
forward the world was changing, web was changing,

632
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,059
things were moving faster, and our competition
was moving faster as well. So choosing React

633
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:04,260
and going with a more modern framework really
helped us accelerate how fast we could build

634
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:08,089
the website, how fast we could get new changes
out the door, how fast we could try improvements

635
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:13,619
for our customers to make the best possible
experience.

636
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:18,240
And because of that we've been at the forefront
of leading what UI design looks like in terms

637
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,720
of web development. We've had a lot of companies
copy us, which we take is a great compliment,

638
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,750
but we were there first because of react and
its ability to move so quickly in terms of

639
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:33,170
design. This is how it ended up turning out
and this is a UI that's big and immersive

640
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:36,225
and completely built in React. So we're very
very proud of it and the result.

641
00:57:36,225 --> 00:57:42,138
[Music]

642
00:57:42,138 --> 00:57:47,804
Netflix was now praising React publicly and with a
second big company betting big on React,

643
00:57:47,804 --> 00:57:54,740
the framework grew in popularity. In fact it kind
of took on a life of its own and the community

644
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,993
started to take off.

645
00:57:56,993 --> 00:58:08,160
[Music]

646
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,932
React at this point was getting more
popular

647
00:58:11,932 --> 00:58:17,145
and somebody on Twitter mentioned "hey it would be cool to have a React conference"

648
00:58:17,145 --> 00:58:19,820
and a lot of people started commenting and

649
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:24,770
tweeting about this. And I went to my manager
Tom Occhino. And he was like: there's like

650
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:31,020
50 tweets about React today, like people are
talking about organizing conferences, should

651
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:34,200
we organize a conference? And I was like,
I don't know what that means, I don't know

652
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,680
how to do that, but like maybe. I was very
opposed to doing a conference. I thought it

653
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:47,079
was very cool that we got so much traction
without really pouring marketing money into it.

654
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:51,920
Even though React came from big tech company
juggernaut Facebook, it was a small group

655
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,099
of people that were like really dedicated
to seeing this thing succeed, so it felt like

656
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:03,079
this very indie you know Rebel Alliance type
of project. And so I was like we don't need

657
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:07,869
a user conference, like we got this cool vibe
going on, let's see how far we can push it.

658
00:59:07,869 --> 00:59:09,202
I was totally wrong.

659
00:59:09,202 --> 00:59:12,630
We had said to ourselves,
I think it would be fun to host a React conference

660
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:18,210
but are there even enough people using React
who would want to go to that, and eventually

661
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:22,959
we decided: Well let's try it, let's try to
host the conference, and see how it goes.

662
00:59:24,237 --> 00:59:30,390
Within a minute, all of the tickets were sold
out and we actually crashed the website that

663
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:34,349
were handling the actual payment system.

664
00:59:36,737 --> 00:59:42,559
Schrep, the CTO of Facebook, actually reached
out to me saying like: hey I have this very

665
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:48,630
important like VP or CTO of some company that
wants in that couldn't get in. Like hey can

666
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:56,010
you do us a favor and I was like I would love
to, it's the CTO and everything, but like

667
00:59:56,010 --> 01:00:00,900
you know we're completely booked. Certainly
we were very surprised about how quickly the

668
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:05,740
tickets had sold out. We didn't realize just
how much the React ecosystem had grown and

669
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:10,302
just how much enthusiasm had been created
by early adopters.

670
01:00:12,618 --> 01:00:23,690
[Music]

671
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:26,780
We put it together pretty quickly as far as

672
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:31,910
conference planning goes and we just had it
on campus in one of our cafes and we bussed

673
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:38,349
people from the nearest hotel. And it was
very, very under produced but it worked out

674
01:00:38,349 --> 01:00:40,120
really, really well.

675
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,510
Good morning everyone
and welcome to React.js conf!

676
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:50,920
The conference went like extremely, extremely
well. As the organizer of the conference,

677
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:56,940
I'm so excited to be here. And we open sourced
a bunch of our projects like React Native

678
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,930
and we started talking about GraphQL, about
Relay. And so yeah it was a massive success.

679
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:09,230
There is this moment where you go and you
see the stage and there's a giant wood cut

680
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:15,940
out like logo of the React atom. And I was
like, my friend Maykel, the designer at Instagram,

681
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:19,750
drew that in front of me like in the middle
of the night before we were going to open

682
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,589
source this thing, because we needed a logo,
and I was like: Maykel just like throw something

683
01:01:22,589 --> 01:01:27,730
together real quick. And now it's this thing
that somebody has built a giant sign with

684
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:32,230
this on it and there's something about the
physical impact of that, that's really cool.

685
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:37,490
That was the moment when it dawned on me that
React was becoming something different, you know.

686
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:43,350
So for a long time what React was to
me was a software project and the reason why

687
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:46,819
I wanted people to adopt it was because I
really thought it would make their software

688
01:01:46,819 --> 01:01:51,150
better and make their lives better and make
their on-call rotations better. There are

689
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:56,109
a lot of reasons why I thought it would help
them. After that conference what I realized

690
01:01:56,109 --> 01:02:00,619
is that React was becoming a community. There
were meetups that would happen the immediate

691
01:02:00,619 --> 01:02:04,880
next week that would have an expanded audience
that they could go deeper into some of the

692
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,440
things that were discussed was really, really
cool and a huge recognition for us that the

693
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:15,920
community was going to be an incredible part
of what would make React work and at that

694
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:21,132
point was definitely already a really important
part of what had gotten React to that point so far.

695
01:02:21,132 --> 01:02:24,048
[Music]

696
01:02:24,048 --> 01:02:28,640
It's proven to me that engaging
with your open source community is actually

697
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,650
more important than the technical work itself,
like if you don't have a community you don't

698
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:37,079
have an open source project. I'm excited that
we just continue rethinking best practices.

699
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:40,799
I want to thank this community for making
it possible for us to keep investing in this

700
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:44,468
and keep working on it. That's all I got,
thanks.

701
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:52,720
It was a real high point for, not just for
me but for the team, and you know I think

702
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:59,681
for Facebook engineering. I think we really
felt like not just validated but like we were

703
01:02:59,681 --> 01:03:05,230
actually like doing something that people
cared about and it was a really, really good

704
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:10,320
feeling. It was already like more widely used
within the company but now it was like, okay

705
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:15,661
how do we actually start converting everything
to React, how do we remove and deprecate all

706
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:21,561
of the other frameworks and really like double
down on React. Oh hey, how is it going? Going

707
01:03:21,561 --> 01:03:27,440
from like an interesting product to this is
the next big thing. So it was a really amazing

708
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:33,599
time to be around and to get the whole company
working together as one, you know, to make

709
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:34,746
this happen.

710
01:03:36,912 --> 01:03:41,575
Let's see, I have some keepsakes up here,

711
01:03:41,575 --> 01:03:46,830
which will be not easy for me to get down

712
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:48,700
but.. Let's see.

713
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:56,740
I have some stickers, oh this is a fun one,
this is the first ever React die cut sticker.

714
01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:01,329
We ordered like a bunch of these and put them
on our laptops and I never wanted to use the

715
01:04:01,329 --> 01:04:07,970
last one that I had. Facebook open source
stickers. Oh some of these will be a trip

716
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:15,160
down memory lane for folks. React conf. We
made you know, 2018 Facebook open source it's

717
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:23,630
a good one. React conf attendee badge. This
was a book from the original React.js conf

718
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:30,940
at Facebook's headquarters so this had a list
of the speakers and the schedule and um here's

719
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:39,110
the keynote. Me and Christopher Chedeau. We
had all sorts of swag made and a bunch of

720
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:45,329
other stuff.. So pretty good stuff, pretty
good memories.

721
01:04:45,329 --> 01:04:51,819
The team became inundated with questions from
the community and a new developer enters React's

722
01:04:51,819 --> 01:04:53,080
orbit.

723
01:04:53,080 --> 01:05:12,201
[Music]

724
01:05:12,201 --> 01:05:20,059
What should I do with my hands?
So you're saying that I should actually uh

725
01:05:20,059 --> 01:05:25,901
start like uh.. Let me focus for a second.
Just for the record, I did not create React,

726
01:05:25,901 --> 01:05:28,252
React was created by Jordan Walke.

727
01:05:29,752 --> 01:05:33,627
I worked at a small startup. We were creating a sort

728
01:05:33,627 --> 01:05:38,940
of a digital publishing platform so there
was a really complex post editor with different

729
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:43,930
blocks or like a scrollable text with like
different effects and stuff. And so creating

730
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:50,030
a dynamic kind of interactive editor for for
these things was really difficult. And were

731
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:53,700
doing it with Backbone. I kind of wanted to
give React a try because it was supposed to

732
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:59,180
solve this problem. The first React component
I wrote was a like button so it was just like

733
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:05,309
a button you click it and it says like you
like this or you and somebody like this or

734
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:11,020
you and like 40 others like this. So there
was a bit of like a split and logic, and then

735
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:18,900
the way you would express this in other Frameworks
at the time, you had to kind of manually watch

736
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:23,549
what's changed and update it. And in React
you could just say, if nobody liked this show

737
01:06:23,549 --> 01:06:28,359
this, if one person like this, show this,
otherwise show this and like it's a very natural

738
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:33,630
way to write this kind of code. And yeah I
just wrote that button and I was like yeah

739
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:40,980
that looks good, ship it. And so we actually
rewrote the entire app in React over the course

740
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:46,470
of like 9 months while still shipping new
features. So React sped up our development

741
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:51,270
so much that we were able to add new features
faster, at the same time as we were replacing

742
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:55,529
old features, that's why I really kind of
fell in love with it.

743
01:06:57,918 --> 01:07:02,849
A lot of things didn't exist back then. Like
there was no such thing as a React ecosystem.

744
01:07:02,849 --> 01:07:08,400
So if you needed something, it didn't exist,
you'd have to write it. So like you'd have

745
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,260
to figure out how to do it because otherwise
you're not going to have a product, right.

746
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:18,099
So that's kind of what I did for a bunch of
things. One of those projects in particular

747
01:07:18,099 --> 01:07:23,023
was.. I just saw a big opportunity there.

748
01:07:24,078 --> 01:07:26,560
It was called React Hot Loader at the time.

749
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:31,750
So I wanted to give a talk about that, but
somebody else had done a talk that mentioned

750
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:36,760
it earlier at React conf. A really clever
fellow called Dan Abramov figured this out

751
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:42,040
and he created the React Hot Loader. And I
felt that well then that just wouldn't be

752
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:46,210
interesting because people kind of already
saw it which in retrospect I don't think it

753
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:50,359
would be true but that's how I saw it at the
time. So I wanted to kind of spice it up a

754
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:55,960
little bit and I wanted to make a proof of
concept of a thing I saw in a Bret Victor

755
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:02,200
demo that is often referred to as time traveling.
If you're designing something embedded in

756
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,630
time, you need to be able to control time,
you need to be able to see across time, otherwise

757
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:11,390
you're designing blind. I didn't really know
how to do it but I thought that's a cool idea

758
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:16,810
for a talk. So I'm gonna send the proposal
if the proposal is successful then I'll just

759
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:20,540
figure it out. And it turned out that the
proposal was more successful than I thought

760
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:25,600
it would be and so I made a proof of concept
for that and that proof of concept became

761
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,928
known as Redux.

762
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:33,270
So my talk is about developer
tools because React and Hot Loading and time

763
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:39,960
travel these are all developer tools. He was
literally creating Redux in service of being

764
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:44,850
able to deliver this talk and I called it
presentation driven development because the

765
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:49,541
thing that shook out of it was you know this
sort of like canonical state management library

766
01:08:49,541 --> 01:08:54,750
for React apps for several years. Most of
my work is around the React ecosystem because

767
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:59,770
that's what inspired me to contribute to the
open source in the first place, but there

768
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:06,120
are two particular projects that I'm going
to talk about today. It was very validating

769
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:14,850
to give that talk but I was not surprised
by the response because well I had my doubts

770
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:21,720
but also I thought the talk was good.. like
I thought it's a really good talk. And I was

771
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:27,250
glad that people also liked it but I think
it was actually not the talk that was really

772
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,080
like the moment for me. I think it was just
like being there.

773
01:09:31,802 --> 01:09:33,350
It kind of felt like

774
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:38,409
going to Hogwarts for the first
time. I think it kind of had this this feeling

775
01:09:38,409 --> 01:09:44,390
because there were all these people who I
only knew them as these avatars and when you

776
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:48,870
meet somebody in person they kind of become
three-dimensional of course. You kind of see

777
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:53,739
the whole picture. And I think it was just
like such a wholesome feeling. It's the feeling

778
01:09:53,739 --> 01:09:58,870
that we are all trying to figure out what
we can do with this thing and we don't know

779
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:01,429
it yet and we're just playing with it.

780
01:10:05,929 --> 01:10:11,850
That's also where I met Jing Chen. I had asked
for her advice before because she's one of

781
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:17,400
the co-creators of the Flux architecture.
So it was nice to meet her in person and she

782
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:23,390
mentioned that actually Facebook is hiring
in London. And so they arranged an interview

783
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:27,429
for me right at the conference which was like
our normal interview process the same I think

784
01:10:27,429 --> 01:10:31,989
like four interviews or something like this
but I missed the second day of the conference

785
01:10:31,989 --> 01:10:37,100
but we just did an interview there and so
that's kind of how I got into Facebook. We

786
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:43,120
just quickly grabbed them out of the conference
a little bit like on the down low and then

787
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:48,533
conducted the interviews in the basement of
a hotel I think.

788
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:54,032
No Dan is special, he's always been a little
special.

789
01:10:54,032 --> 01:10:55,580
I guess like I would think of myself

790
01:10:55,580 --> 01:11:02,520
as like maybe the first member of what would
become the React team as you know it today

791
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:08,989
because I joined a little bit earlier than
I think Andrew, Brian, Luna and and like a

792
01:11:08,989 --> 01:11:14,219
bunch of other people who work with us now.
And I joined at the time when a few people

793
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:19,969
who worked with us before were just about
to leave. So I was kind of in this transitional

794
01:11:19,969 --> 01:11:22,647
period when the team was changing a lot.

795
01:11:22,647 --> 01:11:30,700
[Music]

796
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,200
Remember the old days?

797
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,950
Do you remember the first time you
met Andrew?

798
01:11:35,728 --> 01:11:40,053
Uh I think I've met.. I do! I think

799
01:11:40,053 --> 01:11:43,739
I met him yeah.. I thought it was at React
conf. Well that was the clear moment, maybe,

800
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:49,181
was that the first time? Did you get invited
to React conf because of that.. He had a speech.

801
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:56,729
I met him like I think before that. I met
you and Sophie and Joe and Tim like all in

802
01:11:56,729 --> 01:12:01,580
the same week. Yeah he started asking some
questions that were very similar to the questions

803
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:06,159
that on the team we were talking about internally
and so I just remember like, I gotta connect

804
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:09,580
you with like Sebastian and Jordan and the
rest of the team. Yeah and then also I was

805
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:13,810
like to the recruiters I was like yeah this
guy like we gotta hire this Andrew guy. And

806
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:17,540
I think we were really fortunate early on
to have a bunch of people that kind of stepped

807
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:22,064
up and they were this seems cool, I just want
to be a part of this, I just want to help.

808
01:12:22,064 --> 01:12:26,460
I didn't realize it was kind of like a freshman
class sort of feeling at the time. Sophie

809
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:31,280
had started managing the team around that
time as well and I couldn't have really asked

810
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:38,739
for a better both project and set of colleagues
and team to join. The beginning of phase two.

811
01:12:38,739 --> 01:12:41,822
Yeah, that's cool.

812
01:12:42,544 --> 01:12:47,730
Awesome! I feel
like we really brought it home there at the end.

813
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,170
Like man we're nailing this!

814
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:58,497
[Music]

815
01:12:58,497 --> 01:13:01,600
React was now out of the hands of
its founders.

816
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:08,255
It was ready to take on new life in the care of a 
new community grown and future-minded team. 

817
01:13:08,255 --> 01:13:12,559
We tried to watch some of the numbers like the number of GitHub stars

818
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:15,660
or the number of npm downloads. On Google

819
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:21,690
Trends, how many people are searching for
React and none of those numbers are perfect

820
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:29,340
but basically all of them kept going up over
time and eventually got to a point where we

821
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:35,810
looked at it and said oh yeah like millions
of people essentially are using React.

822
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:43,090
There are a lot of little details in how we did
things that encourages an ecosystem to participate,

823
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:49,060
that were critical parts in making it what
it is today. We didn't put everything in the

824
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:54,389
framework. We left a lot of it to the ecosystem
to innovate. And we got a lot of contributions,

825
01:13:54,389 --> 01:14:01,239
we got a lot of interest that way, we got
a lot of things spurring from that. It was

826
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:07,679
not ever a foregone conclusion. Like it's
still surreal to me that it's as popular as

827
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:13,550
it is. It's this great example of this like
underdog technology within a big company where

828
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:18,040
there could have been these forces that really
pushed back on it. I think a lot of elements

829
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:24,310
of good timing, good fortune, good luck, good
leadership support, all sort of like aggregated

830
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:31,740
to allow React to be a success, that had we
missed a few of those or had a handful more

831
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:36,550
things failed instead of succeeded, then I
do not think React would be in the spot that

832
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:42,840
it is today. I feel like you can't take anyone
out of it and have it be what it became. I

833
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,550
think in the early days obviously Jordan,
right. Like this thing wouldn't exist. And

834
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:51,560
then Jing Chen just absolutely critical. I
mean she was so instrumental in the early

835
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:56,070
days of React that it just wouldn't have been
a thing that we cared about if it didn't prove

836
01:14:56,070 --> 01:15:03,449
itself. And then Shane O'Sullivan is responsible
for you know really I mean a very hard decision

837
01:15:03,449 --> 01:15:07,770
to like I'm gonna go this path instead of
that thing. And then the engineers that worked

838
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:12,000
on refining and iterating on it and turning
it into something good it was Chedeau and

839
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,600
Paul O'Shannessy and Pete Hunt. And my manager
Adam Wolff, when I was like you know asking

840
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,860
all these questions about like should we be
doing, like is this even worth it, especially

841
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:24,780
after JS conf when we were feeling defeated,
you know, he was there to pick me back up

842
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:29,520
and be like: no look it is delivering value,
this is good, keep going. And there's different

843
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:34,150
phases too right, you have the early, early
days and you had the like for the next literally

844
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:40,300
almost we're going on 10 years now, with Sebastian's
technical leadership and Andrew and Dan and

845
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:46,830
Dominic and Flarney and Sophie and I just
feel like it's just a group of incredible

846
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:53,150
people and if you take any of them out of
it it just looks pretty different. It was

847
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:58,870
really a team effort, it was really a team
effort from the very beginning.

Misko Hevery says that awesome solutions
are rarely created by large organizations.

850
01:16:12,679 --> 01:16:19,280
It's almost always one person with passion
and vision that slowly start to infect others.

851
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:25,370
This is a great summary of how React became
React. Because it was never inevitable, it

852
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:31,600
was always this wild idea that kept gathering
momentum, person by person. And many expected

853
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:37,880
React to fail and if it weren't for the hard
work of a few determined developers

854
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,840
it very well could have.

855
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:48,639
This is just the beginning of the React story.
The story of how a community transformed an

856
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:53,977
underdog UI library into the most popular
JavaScript framework today.

Jordan right now be like: interview! 

860
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:43,720

so close to death.
