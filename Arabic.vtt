When I got the offer to work at Facebook,
I told my mom, I was like really excited.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.840
The Social Network the movie had just come
out and she had you know seen it recently

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.970
and she was actively discouraging me from
joining because she was like Mark Zuckerberg

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.769
doesn't seem like a very nice boy. Facebook
in the time I was there was, I don't think

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.170
there'll be anything like it ever again. It
was certainly not like anything that I had

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.129
experienced before. In fact just a couple
months after I joined Kanye West came to visit

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:11.049
Facebook's campus and he got up on a table
in the cafe and you know rapped a few bars

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.321
and I was working mostly with this guy who
had just graduated from college and I was

00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:20.299
trying to explain to him you know I've worked
these crap jobs in software, at that point

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.410
had been like 10 or 15 years, nothing like
this ever happens, not to software engineers.

"You're my stressing, you're my masseuse,

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.159
the time, I think, was going through this
little bit of an existential crisis as to

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:44.189
whether it was like a real programming language
or a toy programming language. And so there

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:49.040
was a lot of churn. So you had jQuery was
popular and MooTools was popular and there

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.459
was so many different like warring frameworks
to try to get the mind share. And there's

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.390
a lot of similarities between them but each
one had its kind of bespoke differences and

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.780
none of them were actually really fantastic
for building really kind of complicated user

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.220
interfaces and apps. There was this trend
towards more sophisticated applications that

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.230
do more stuff and at Facebook we still had
a primarily sort of server rendered technology

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.299
stack which you know, one of the things that
we fought against for a really long time was

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.930
just growing JavaScript bundle sizes so as
we moved more and more stuff to the client,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.370
the client got slower and slower so we actually
swung the pendulum towards server-side rendering

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.270
and towards you know minimal amounts of JavaScript
for a while. And there was this feeling that

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.590
we knew that what we were doing for client-side
development wasn't working but also that server

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.770
side wasn't going to get us all the way there.
So I think that was the kind of environment

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.720
that React came out of.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:57.620
[Music]

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.260
I joined Facebook back in 2010. I've been
doing a lot of open source work particularly

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.229
in the JavaScript world. I was a committer
on the Dojo.js toolkit back in the day, which

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:14.210
is one of the the granddaddies of the JavaScript
movement along with prototype and jQuery.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.270
I spent my first two years at Facebook on
the mobile team. We had started off a big

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.289
push to compete with Apple and Google and
we thought that our best chance of success

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:32.419
as a company was to go directly to the web
and really push to build out the HTML5 ecosystem.

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.819
So as part of that we developed, myself and
two other engineers called Vladimir Kolesnikov

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.970
and Will Bailey, built a framework called
Bolt.js so named because we bolted together

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.640
a bunch of things that each of us liked.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.630
Bolt was basically more or less Facebook's implementation

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.699
of a client-side MVC. I think it was like
a pretty good version, maybe a better version,

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.148
of things like Backbone and a couple of other
Frameworks that had existed at the time.

00:06:01.148 --> 00:06:08.510
But it was born from a place of the specific constraints
of Facebook. It's the heart of your Facebook

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.190
experience. Completely rethought from the
ground up. We've been working on it all year

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:20.400
and we're calling it Timeline. Facebook was
one of the first big products that was really

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.759
an experience more than anything else. You're
not trying to buy groceries or get tickets

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:30.259
or anything like that on Facebook, you really
just want to be entertained. And as such you

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:35.960
know the user interface itself needs to be
really pleasing. Bolt was not a tool belt,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:42.389
it was truly an application development framework.
Something designed and meant to build complicated

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:48.580
interactive rich apps and was being used to
build pretty complicated very real products

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.330
at Facebook at the time. We ended up having
to essentially replicate most of Facebook,

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:59.111
all the various apps, be it timeline, chat,
newsfeed. We had a whole photos app that we

00:06:59.111 --> 00:07:04.440
built and so obviously the team had to expand
greatly. Like that so I think at some point

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.270
we probably had maybe 25 engineers working
on all this between building Bolt and building

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.420
apps built on Bolt and that's just on the
mobile team. Bolt was never the problem, it

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.460
was the architecture that would eventually
break down for us. As the product itself got

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.690
more complex and as we added more engineers
to the team, we didn't hit a wall but it started

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.460
to get really, really hard to make changes.
And so you know that was around the time that

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.301
Jordan was on the ads team and he's like I
wonder, there's got to be a better way.

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:48.320
Jordan is an enigmatic figure. He uh he's
a little secretive so there's not much that

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:54.699
I know about him. Jordan and I aren't necessarily..
we haven't necessarily been in the spotlight

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:59.111
much. Especially Jordan kind of shied away
from spotlights since the early days. Jordan

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:05.979
was a product engineer at the time, working
on ads and ads has one of the most complicated

00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:12.830
pieces of UI across all of Facebook at the
moment. On the ads team they were hitting much

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.880
you know really hitting the limits of what
you can do without React complexity wise.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.560
And just the developers ability to hold in
their head and understand a bit of code that

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.370
somebody else wrote and you know look at the
screen and say okay this code is doing that

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:32.560
and I need to know why. And Jordan had a lot
of very interesting ideas around how you could

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.550
take what we had done in Bolt and make it
much more functional and make it more ability..

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:41.269
make it easier for it to scale with people's
ability to understand large applications.

00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:44.990
And so we had a lot of ongoing dialogue and
he would come back and forth to us with various

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:49.720
ideas how to change it. I think one of the
original names for react was FBolt which is

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.450
Functional Bolt.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:59.310
He saw that there was an opportunity to do
it.. to solve some of the tricky parts in

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:06.500
Bolt in an easier way. So what Jordan decided
to do, or at least the story that he had told

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:14.710
me, was: "hey wouldn't it be easier if, any
time anything happened, in the app: API state

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:19.840
changes, user type something, we just blow
away the entire UI and we re-render all of it".

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.300
If you look at what every other framework
was doing at the time, it was called two-way

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.940
data binding and this was not that. It was
like: forget about data binding we're not

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.459
going to do that at all. Anytime anything
changes we're just going to re-render and

00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:38.380
then there's an asterisk which says well we're
not going to re-render everything, we're going

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:43.690
to try to render as little as possible but
conceptually we're not going to manage these

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:48.589
relationships between views and models, we're
just gonna.. Honestly I thought it was completely

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:53.880
crazy. At the time I was really down on frameworks
in general and I thought there was no way

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.190
that was going to work. To many people that
seemed like magic, it was so far outside of

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:05.311
everybody's idea of how things should work
and do work that yeah it took a lot of convincing.

00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:32.937
[Music]

00:10:32.937 --> 00:10:39.240
I've been working at Facebook for 10 years
now. I met this person called Jordan Walke.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.770
Some people told me he had an interesting
project about JavaScript and I may be interested.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:49.149
And so I had this meeting with him and one
thing he asked me at the beginning of the

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:57.760
meeting was: what is the most difficult thing
to do in the front-end right now? And I mean,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.230
I was six months out of school, I was like
I don't know and the thing he told me is:

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:09.470
updates. You need to find the DOM node that
is going to change, you need to change the

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:16.110
listener to the click event and remove it
and do all of this, which is pretty complicated.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.560
And this was also a massive source of bugs
within the Facebook codebase.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.610
I was like, yeah you're right, this is probably the hardest
thing.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.840
And he was like: I have a solution for this.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.310
I was like, okay this guy is crazy,
like this is never going to work, it's never

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:38.800
going to be performant. The meeting ended
and for a few weeks I forgot about the idea.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.450
But one weekend I was like, okay maybe I should
try this, maybe there's something to it.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:53.920
Before joining Facebook, I worked on a way to find
your guild in World of Warcraft and we basically

00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:01.320
needed to search through like 20.000 guilds.
And I did a lot of performance work to be

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.700
the fastest way possible to display when you
change all of those filters in real time.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:12.829
And I was like: okay I spent months, full
time, working on making this super performant,

00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:19.240
let's try it with React. And in practice it
took me like half an hour to write it and

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:25.130
it was actually not as performant but around
the same order of magnitude at performance.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:30.600
And I was like mind blown and to this day
I became the biggest React fan in the world.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.839
I was in the photos team and spending all
of my working hours like trying to use React

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:40.290
on my own projects in the photos team, evangelizing.
I felt like it could change the world

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.211
which it did.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:50.440
[Music]

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:55.880
[Chantastic] Jordan is making headway on his
project. He's gotten others involved and they're

00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:03.329
seeing the value. But not everyone is impressed.
One manager started to take notice but saw

00:13:03.329 --> 00:13:09.790
Jordan's project as a distraction. So they
asked Lee Byron to meet with Jordan and put

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.600
a stop to it (to focus efforts on Bolt). We
get into a room. Instantly I knew that this

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.300
was going to be weird because we showed up
with very different energies. I'm showing

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:23.950
up with this like, okay Jordan I want to understand
what's going on with your project but I also

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.870
want to help make sure that we are spending
our time well and we're working on things

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.100
that are gonna have longevity and solving
problems we want to have. And Jordan came

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.860
in with like, can I show you a demo of what
I've been working on like this is so exciting

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.740
and it does this and it does that. And eventually
like towards the end of this meeting with

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:46.709
him I had to kind of admit like he had something
really compelling. Like I was now really interested

00:13:46.709 --> 00:13:51.670
in learning more about what he was doing.
So Jordan's pitch to me was like I only want

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.810
to invest in this and work on it if it's going
to be something that people will use and if

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.199
that's not going to be the case, sure we're
not going to do this. He's like but I feel

00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:04.290
really strongly that all the ways we've been
doing UI development up until now have been

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.230
flawed. Whether they're a JavaScript library
that doesn't quite work for us or whether

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:14.000
it's like a 30 year old tried and true model
for doing UI application development. They

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.260
all suffer from the same base problem: a state
management and I think this is the way forward,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:27.759
and Lee if you could just dig into the code
and learn more and try it and then come back

00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:32.120
and we'll talk about this again, then we can
figure this out. I was like all right all

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:38.690
right and so I did I dug around the code and
it was um a little hard to understand, but

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.339
I eventually got to play with it and got to
build a couple of things and had to admit,

00:14:43.339 --> 00:14:48.060
coming away, that like yes there was something
incredibly interesting there. And that was

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:53.730
how I got sucked into the project and I ended
up working on it quite a bit for the the next couple of months.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:59.209
Lee brings this rigor and sort of design
mentality to these things that

00:14:59.209 --> 00:15:03.940
really helped with the initial versions of
React in terms of standardizing it and turning

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.459
it from something that was kind of like an
ugly baby that had just grown up at Facebook

00:15:08.459 --> 00:15:10.918
to something that really people could approach
from around the world.

00:15:10.918 --> 00:15:12.810
[Music]

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:21.000
There were a couple of problems that I faced right away
when trying to understand the code base and

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.990
build something. Not only was the the set
of tools and the mental models really different

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:35.220
from what I was used to as a UI engineer.
The syntax and the programming concepts involved,

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.850
just the terminology, was also really different.
My takeaway was, you know, okay the whole

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:44.790
bid here was that this would be simpler but
I can't help but feel like this is really

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:51.790
complicated. Mostly as a desire for me to
understand the model but also with a hope

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:58.800
that it would kind of end up helping resolve
some things, I wanted to build a glossary.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:06.300
Like what are all the things the concepts
and then what are all the actions or verbs

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.649
that are going on here. And so I literally
just listed them all out. And then I would

00:16:10.649 --> 00:16:13.610
go back to Jordan, I'd go back to other people
working on it, and ask questions like did

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:17.199
I get this right? Are these definitions right?
And they go yeah okay, no you should really

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:20.380
think about it that way, and be like okay,
well that's not how this.. And it would go

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.700
back and forth and back and forth and I'd
be honing these definitions and along the

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:30.040
way we'd realize like, oh this concept and
that concept are the same, we're going to

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.080
name them one thing instead of two things.
So unwinding all of this and essentially writing

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:41.100
up what ended up being like a reimagining
of the component life cycle and therefore

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:46.899
sort of the entire front-facing API for React.
And I was very happy to see like incredible

00:16:46.899 --> 00:16:50.610
enthusiasm around that. Jordan was like "ah
this is amazing, this really clarifies the

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:56.050
ideas". At that point a handful of other folks
had gotten involved with the project too and

00:16:56.050 --> 00:17:02.060
then I spent sort of the next month or so,
sort of piece by piece folding those into

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:08.560
place and pretty significantly changing the
surface API of React in the process. That

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:14.400
was I think the first shift from this being
a thing that existed mostly in Jordan's head,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.630
that other people were playing with, to a
thing that all of a sudden felt owned by the

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:23.280
whole team. Where team here is like a collection
of UI Engineers scattered across Facebook

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.270
who were sort of bought in on this vision,
who now felt that we now have the same terminology

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:32.380
we can use when someone has a question, anyone
can jump in and answer it rather than only

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.480
Jordan. That was the first big shift.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.080
[Music]

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.320
[Dog snoring]

00:17:40.929 --> 00:17:49.410
One of the first projects that React was used
for was the UFI, the Universal Feedback Interface,

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:54.250
which is basically the likes, comments and
shares at the bottom of each post. This was

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:59.450
still during Facebook's kind of web era, when
Facebook on the web was like the sort of big

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:05.690
driver of engagement. Newsfeed had a billion
people hitting it every day and was massively

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:11.030
tuned for performance. Heavily interactive
surface both on the input side of course you're

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:15.090
like clicking it to add likes, you're typing
into it to add comments, but also on the receiving

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:18.970
side we want comments to come in live, so
as you're looking at it as a comment comes

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:24.650
in we want it to just pop up right there.
And there was this product desire for that

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:31.540
interface to feel almost like a one-off chat
thread, and that was so cool at that time.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:36.150
And as that started to work the second thread
was well okay if this can work for this really

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:41.710
isolated sense of messaging then what if it
could work for messaging as a whole and this

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:47.740
was another really complicated and fraught
with bug surface area. That was when a lot

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:54.780
of the ideas in React congealed, the JSX syntax
was introduced and some of the ideas about

00:18:54.780 --> 00:19:00.000
how to work with data and React sort of were
clarified. A couple of our UI Engineers, along

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.280
with the messaging team, if I remember correctly
Jing Chen was sort of the champion of this

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.960
project, realized that we needed a completely
new way to think about state too.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.320
[People clapping]

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:17.669
So my name is Jing and I'm a software engineer
in the product infrastructure team at Facebook.

00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:23.520
[Chantastic] Flux is an application architecture designed
around React's principle of unidirectional

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:30.250
data flow. Paired with Flux, React could go
beyond the view layer to model entire applications.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:34.700
This shift in how to think about state paired
very well with how React was thinking about

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:39.860
updating UI and ended up being sort of the
next chapter for how to think about React

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:46.909
being more than just how do you model complicated
UI but how do you model sufficiently complicated

00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:50.340
applications. Like this was something that
expanded the full screen and multiple touch

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:55.240
points and had navigation to it and it allowed
us to step into that next chapter. I remember

00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:00.419
asking Jing like hey how's it going with this
React stuff? Do you think this is going to

00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:04.340
work? She was like, yeah this is pretty good,
I'm pretty sure it's gonna work. That was

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.702
when I became more convinced.

00:20:06.702 --> 00:20:21.830
[Music]

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:27.530
Instagram joined Facebook in 2012. I think
we had started calling it React by then and

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:32.330
there was a couple of engineers from Facebook
that went to join Instagram to help them expand

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:37.860
the product offering. At the time Instagram
was just an iOS and an Android app and they

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.100
wanted to have a web presence as well.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:45.980
[Music]

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.986
I spent 11 years in San Francisco, it was really fun

00:20:49.986 --> 00:20:56.600
I made a lot of great friends
but the change of pace out in the countryside is great.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.800
It's just very peaceful
and nice.

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:00.680
I went to Facebook straight out of school.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:05.780
I studied computer science undergrad
and I got a master's degree. Facebook was,

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:12.750
believe it or not, the cool place to work
back in 2010. It was this great product, that

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:18.420
everybody used. It was super cool on college
campuses and I was really excited to work there.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:23.350
[Music]

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:30.000
I joined Facebook video. The pitch was, we're
the third largest video site in the world,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.280
after YouTube and Dailymotion I think, and
there was like one engineer working on it

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.970
and like you get to be engineer number two
and I was like that sounds pretty cool. We

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.861
worked really closely with the iOS photos
team in the Android Photos team and we were

00:21:42.861 --> 00:21:47.609
building an Instagram killer and nobody remembers
this but it was called Facebook Camera.

00:21:48.109 --> 00:21:54.410
One morning the photo's team got called into the
office early. They said like be at HQ at 8am

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:57.789
and then the VP of engineering was like hey
we bought Instagram, they're your new co-workers now.

00:21:57.789 --> 00:22:02.980
And these were like the people that were
like our fierce competitors you know. We looked

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.200
at them a little bit as the enemy, I'm sure
they looked at us a little bit as the enemy.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.950
They were a really small team at the time,
they had their core fundamentals really nailed

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:15.370
but there was a lot of stuff they needed to
figure out, that they did not have the team

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.730
to figure out on their own and a big one of
those was what does it mean for Instagram

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:23.140
to be on the web. The web experience is really
important for driving growth and so this was

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:28.100
a pretty important priority and so me and
this designer, Maykel Loomans, started building

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:34.370
all the web stuff. And that's kind of where
React enters the picture, when we started

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:35.408
developing this website.

00:22:35.408 --> 00:22:42.407
[Music]

00:22:42.407 --> 00:22:49.270
We were given this mandate to use client rendering
so I went to the product infrastructure team

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:56.830
at Facebook, which was run by Tom Occhino.
Product infrastructure's role was to support

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:03.830
any team that needed help and do it in a way
that your key indicators of success are going

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:08.380
to be other teams saying "yeah that really
helped us". You go to them and you kind of

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:15.060
consult the Council of Elders and they give
you their recommendation and I said, hey we

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.900
need to do client rendering, what do we do?
And the recommendation at the time was yeah

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.420
we don't know. We've got like three different
things that we're working on, you should go

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:33.809
try one. We had something called Bolt.js,
there was a second thing called JS.HTML and

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:36.554
then there was this this thing called React.

00:23:38.053 --> 00:23:39.850
Pete went and spoke to Jordan about using

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:44.620
React and he came and talked to me about potentially
using Bolt for it but I think he really, really

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:50.559
liked Jordan's ideas around functional programming.
The conceptual model of react was like crazy

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:55.830
innovative and it really, really spoke to
me. My background was in distributed systems.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:24:01.610
I was not somebody that loved front-end or
thought front-end was doing things well, so

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:06.070
the fact that React came in with like a totally
fresh approach and didn't really care too

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:11.070
much about existing best practices, like I
was I was on board with that. So while I had

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:16.289
evaluated all three I really just dove in
on React to build a prototype first and that

00:24:16.289 --> 00:24:22.870
ended up shipping on Instagram.com which was
the second use of React in production ever

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:30.590
and the first use of building a full application
end to end in React.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.979
When I chose React for Instagram it was not
well known within Facebook and it was this

00:24:34.979 --> 00:24:37.000
kind of crazy science experiment.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:45.520
Not even close. By the time Instagram was,
and you know Pete started playing with it,

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:50.909
it was significantly better than it was in
the early, early stage but it still needed

00:24:50.909 --> 00:24:55.200
a ton of iteration. We had to take this thing
that was very much tied to Facebook's infrastructure

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:01.720
which back then was a big giant PHP application
and I had to go get that working in a Django

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:07.440
application which is a totally different system.
And what was key was not doing that once but

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.049
making that a repeatable process and making
sure that that pipeline didn't break. I think

00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:17.059
he hit a number of really interesting problems
along the way which quite proved the fact

00:25:17.059 --> 00:25:22.130
that React was not quite ready for that scale
and along the way Pete, and the team that

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.980
he was working with, built a lot of really
interesting things.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:35.524
[Music]

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:56.190
Some of these products ended up being fairly
successful. There were relatively short time

00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:03.800
to deliver a relatively high quality product.
That showed that this model could work and

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:10.010
it was not just that, but people liked developing
using it. And so that kind of spread and took

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:15.510
off and especially is it got more and more
investment, it became clear that this was

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:22.110
what we wanted to use and it was really ads
that was kind of using Bolt more. It had a

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:28.230
higher level of investment, more people working
in that code base, that already knew it and

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:32.930
more components so it was a harder shift to
make.

00:26:35.929 --> 00:26:40.340
The ads team just before I joined ads from
the mobile team had done a full rewrite of

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:45.820
the ads creation flow into Bolt. Which took
them I think upwards of six months replacing

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:52.340
a very old PHP application with what time
was considered a very modern JavaScript application.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:58.679
But at the same time React was also now actually
deployed for real on Facebook and had a team

00:26:58.679 --> 00:27:03.000
that was forming around it. So we now had
two viable frameworks that were both live

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.360
on Facebook, both solving real problems. We
shouldn't have two. Especially two that were

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.919
similar. Similar enough to confuse people.
Like if you looked at the code, their code

00:27:12.919 --> 00:27:17.029
almost looked identical but that worked really
differently. It would actually be an absolute

00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:22.420
nightmare if you had to work in both. So we
had to decide which to use.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:26.890
[Music]

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:31.580
A lot of this ended up being a conversation
between myself and Jordan. We did an evaluation

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:36.660
of both of them. A lot of performance-based
stuff and trying to figure out where the edge

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:42.030
cases were. On the pro side of React, obviously
there's all the things that we know now: it

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:46.890
handles complexity way, way more. Even when
writing the ads creation flow in Bolt we had

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:51.760
already hit one place that you just could
not do in Bolt without writing spaghetti code,

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.940
and you can do in React. So we knew in the
future even if it was only 10% of the experience

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:01.230
we were building, we're going to run into
this problem again. Now it might only be 10%

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.169
unmaintainable but as you scale that across
a company that is growing rapidly, this becomes

00:28:05.169 --> 00:28:10.140
an absolute mess. The cons of it on the other
hand were that React in a lot of ways was

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.860
not battle tested yet. There's a lot of things
that simply didn't work in React. It couldn't

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.970
handle forms, they'd never done a text box
and there's a lot of complexities around handing

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.610
awkward form controls like radio buttons and
so on that it messed up. Just performance

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:27.679
issues where it would try and re-render large
blocks so they hadn't had to do all of the

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:32.830
performance improvements that obviously exist
now. On the organizational side the other

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:39.590
con was that we had just done the six-month
rewrite in Bolt. Facebook had done an IPO

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:45.750
recently and the stock had halved since IPO.
Facebook wasn't making enough money and so

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:49.870
the ads team is the team that makes, you know,
that's where the money starts. If we stop

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:55.679
for four months we're gonna have to tell everybody
sorry no money for you so there was a lot

00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:59.150
of conversation back and forth about all this.
It got very difficult. Initially a lot of

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:03.620
the engineers that used Bolt, including Shane,
realized just what you said. Like look we've

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.760
invested so much in this thing and it's really
worked for all this stuff, certainly we can

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.100
work through the next set of challenges we're
having. So initially there was opposition

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:16.299
to React coming in and saying like how are
you gonna, you know, this new thing that's

00:29:16.299 --> 00:29:20.750
not even proven yet. This is our business,
this is really important. When Jordan and

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:25.890
I were working through it, there was definitely
uh some emotions uh there um and mostly I

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:29.640
think it came from uh each of us having a
lack of context of where the other one was

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:34.510
coming from. So I think there was a lot of
talking past each other. In the end Mike Schroepfer

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:41.360
stepped in and said, look make the right technical
decision, make the right long-term decision

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:47.159
and whatever it is I'll back you up. But if
you need to pause product development for

00:29:47.159 --> 00:29:53.070
four months you can. We all kind of just got
in rooms and you know worked through all these

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:57.320
things and got everything out in the air of
what's a technical problem, what's an organization

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:03.390
problem, what's a financial problem and kind
of a came to the understanding eventually

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:09.220
through uh with lots and lots of coffee that
React was the right way to go, but um it was

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.420
not a straight line at all.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.799
He ultimately was one of the biggest proponents or decision

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:21.330
makers in ads switching everything over to
React and that doesn't happen in most companies.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:27.289
In most companies if that's your baby project
you try to undermine the other, the upstart,

00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:31.860
because you're you know you're really defensive
over your own thing. That was not the vibe

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:37.705
at Facebook at the time and I think that Shane
in particular really exemplified that.

00:30:38.816 --> 00:30:45.070
There was still a lot of work to do on the ads creation
flow. Tensions were mounting and the team

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:50.232
was stuck. Here again to get them unstuck,
is Jing Chen.

00:30:50.676 --> 00:30:54.271
We'd have this thorny management issue and a lot of people disagreeing with each other,

00:30:54.271 --> 00:30:55.660
up and down the management chain

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.960
on both sides of you know in ads and in this
product infrastructure group, that was building

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.130
React, and we'd send Jing in to talk to the engineers and everyone would come out, like

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:08.539
patting each other on the back, full agreement,
a plan to move forward. So she's great at

00:31:08.539 --> 00:31:14.430
building a consensus because she's able to
drill into the important technical details,

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:18.520
identify them really quickly and get everyone
talking about the same thing. She obviously

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:23.330
helped both build the product but she also
made sure that every time we found a bug in

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:28.380
React or just something that it didn't handle
yet, she either stepped back from product

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:32.269
and then just fixed the framework. Or she
went back to the team and said look we need

00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:36.340
two or three engineers working on this stuff
for the next month to unblock the ads team.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:40.580
The ads manager was complicated enough that
it actually ended up being a really great

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:48.020
source of performance improvements and finding
like, where are the true points where it just

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:53.039
doesn't quite scale. So I think it was a lot
of using the building blocks that we had and

00:31:53.039 --> 00:31:56.110
as you start to assemble them into a really
complicated looking application, what are

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:59.410
the new problems that come out of that, that
we need to solve. And there was definitely

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:04.500
a lot of those. This is one of the most fun
intense periods of my career as I remember

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.289
it. We would be going to meet with the team
and we would have to help them put some feature

00:32:08.289 --> 00:32:14.380
in and we would code it up ourselves first
in React just to make sure that the that they

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.740
wouldn't hit any rough edges. Or more like
to find all the rough edges that we knew they'd

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:24.100
hit and figure out what the solutions would
be. So it was really exciting because we were

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.279
working on two things at the same time. One
was delivering this really complicated, really

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:33.110
important software project for Facebook: the
ads manager. And the other was refining this

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:40.330
framework that we really believed in which
was React. By the time we had rebuilt the

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:44.460
ads creation flow, which I think took about
four months, it had been battle tested with

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:49.880
basically everything about the browser supports,
all the form fields and everything, and also

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:55.950
massive performance issues that had been resolved,
so at that point it was kind of felt that

00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:01.710
it was ready to be open sourced because you
know we we used it in multiple different types

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:06.821
of contexts and that you know it would actually
be generally useful to the public.

00:33:06.821 --> 00:33:17.634
[Music]

00:33:17.634 --> 00:33:20.666
[Mumbled question]
What did you say, Evan?

00:33:21.832 --> 00:33:25.680
Uh there is not, sorry.

00:33:26.186 --> 00:33:29.348
Open sourcing React was never
a question for me. That was the

00:33:29.348 --> 00:33:35.370
goal from the very beginning. Tom had this
idea, he called it project perception, and

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:40.580
he was really angry I think it's probably
the best word for it. He was angry that Facebook

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:46.001
was hiring all these luminaries from the JavaScript
world. They would come to Facebook and

00:33:46.001 --> 00:33:50.360
because we discouraged people from writing
client-side JavaScript and because it was

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.900
a hard environment to maneuver in, they would
actually go pick up mobile because that was

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.970
where a lot of the interesting client-side
development was happening. And Tom was determined

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:05.389
to change this around. I remember going to
this conference and I was talking to someone

00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:09.169
and I told them I worked at Facebook on JavaScript
and they're like why would you do that? I

00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:13.040
hate what Facebook does to the JavaScript
industry. You have hired all these really

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.050
great people from these really great projects
and we have no idea what they're working on

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:23.159
now. They've given nothing back. So I think
when React came along I started very early

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:28.770
on talking about if this thing works for us
I really want us to find a path to open source.

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:33.859
And I was running that up the management chain
very early so when the time came to open source

00:34:33.859 --> 00:34:40.520
it, there were some meetings, it was controversial
but we had all the support we needed already.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:52.220
The process of open sourcing is interesting.
There's first a technical problem to solve.

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:55.609
You have to figure out how to extract it out
of your infrastructure and make it work in

00:34:55.609 --> 00:35:01.180
the open source, which is all the homework
that we did for Instagram. We made this call

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:05.849
that like we will not impact developer productivity
at all, it's going to be entirely on the open

00:35:05.849 --> 00:35:10.660
source team, which was just a bunch of people
that wanted to open source it, to make it

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:17.120
work. Then actually pulling the trigger on
open source, we had to write a lot of documentation.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:21.710
We spent actually a lot of time with the documentation
to explain like, hey what is React, what are

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:27.170
all the concepts and we tried to put ourselves
in the shoes of somebody that want to build

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:33.220
an app. How do we give the documentation in
a way it helps them do that. Paul O'Shannessy

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:37.630
did a lot of this because he really had the
experience with what the ecosystem needed

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:46.240
to make this work at the time. Paul O'Shannessy
was a huge force on open sourcing. As was

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:51.770
James Pearce who was the head of Facebook
open source. James had joined the company

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:57.720
and he really wanted to change Facebook's
open source image. We had previously open

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.080
sourced a lot of stuff but we let it rot.
We would say, hey we're an open source company,

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.160
here's our great framework and then we would
just never maintain it. And James and Paul

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.970
in particular were pretty instrumental in
saying, hey if we're going to open source

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:15.990
React, we're going to do it right. Internally
there was a lot of excitement because we had

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:21.409
already been using this thing for a while and it
was working for us, we were excited about it.

00:36:21.853 --> 00:36:27.450
We chose JSconf US which was kind
of the, I don't know, the Oscars of JavaScript

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:31.750
- is that fair representation maybe? You know
all the celebrities are there and everyone's

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:36.340
paying attention and everybody watches it
live on YouTube. Tom and Jordan put together

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:40.490
this presentation. Tom is a great speaker
and Jordan is a brilliant engineer, it was

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:43.720
like a Lennon and McCartney type of situation.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.720
There was no way that this thing could possibly fail.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:54.684
[Music]

00:36:54.684 --> 00:37:00.669
It was in Florida, at like 9 00 a.m.
We were in Menlo Park and we woke up early,

00:37:00.669 --> 00:37:05.050
we took the first bus into the office. It
was completely empty and we're getting ready

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:09.241
to like press the button on the repo to open
source it. Jordan and I were all excited we

00:37:09.241 --> 00:37:13.140
got up on stage. I'm going to talk a bit about
how we do JavaScript application development

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:17.560
at Facebook. It was a little unconventional,
I did a little bit of it, he did more of it.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:23.750
So along with react we are shipping an embeddable
XML syntax and we're calling that JSX. And

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:29.301
we jumped into showing some code and that
code looked different, it looked weird. Here

00:37:29.301 --> 00:37:36.120
we have React used with JSX. And people were
rightfully skeptical we'll call it.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.935
Everyone hated it, everyone thought it was awful!

00:37:39.935 --> 00:37:47.492
[Music]

00:37:47.492 --> 00:37:53.080
Internally we were expecting a much better
reception. Or at least an "oh that's interesting

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:57.500
reception". We thought there'd be some language
nerds in there who would think "oh I can

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:01.020
do fully functional programming in the UI,
oh at least that's interesting". It was a

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:05.260
really humbling experience, it was kind of
a letdown for us because we had worked nights

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:09.314
and weekends on getting this thing open sourceable
and then when we go to launch it, everyone

00:38:09.314 --> 00:38:13.360
hated it. The thing that everyone focuses
on is that people really hated JSX.

00:38:17.955 --> 00:38:20.514
I haven't watched this video in a while.

00:38:24.736 --> 00:38:30.720
See these divs are not exactly what you're
used to they're not DOM nodes, they're special

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:35.620
reactives and I'll get to why that's important.
I don't remember thinking that they were hating

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:42.962
it. I don't remember at all thinking that
they were like tweeting a bunch of stuff.

00:38:42.962 --> 00:38:46.650
This is the slide for sure. We haven't talked
about any problems we're trying to solve,

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:50.630
we haven't talked about why this is working
for us or what were the principles of design.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:56.849
We're just like boom here's some XML in your
JavaScript and people are like hey what is

00:38:56.849 --> 00:38:58.791
happening. Uh poor Jordan..

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.000
What we didn't really fully understand
was how big of a delta

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.560
there was between where the rest of the world
was in the JavaScript community and where

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:13.060
Facebook was. I don't blame them. I don't
think anybody who tweeted Facebook is crazy

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:18.070
was crazy themselves. I think they were kind
of right, we were a little crazy.

00:39:19.459 --> 00:39:25.589
I think there was a moment for me personally where
I felt like, you know, my goal with the open

00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:30.740
sourcing of this was to get us closer to the
community and I may have set us back a step.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:35.430
I may have demonstrated that we actually have
no idea what we're doing because what we're

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:39.295
doing is so much different than what the rest
of the community was doing. And internally

00:39:39.295 --> 00:39:45.280
there was a "well we messed that up". We made
the wrong call.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.389
Because I think the measure

00:39:47.389 --> 00:39:51.950
of success would have been "wow Facebook engineering
is doing some really cool stuff" and instead

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.401
it was "Facebook engineering has no idea what
they're doing".

00:39:54.401 --> 00:39:57.940
I think that JSconf appearance

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:02.480
might have been Jordan's last conference for
a good few years. I think Tom Occhino also

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.650
didn't go back for a while as well. It turned
into a bit of a troll fest for no good reason.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:12.589
And particularly for something that was as
innovative and useful and you know just fantastic

00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:16.319
for developer productivity and just, it's
literally a gift to everybody. Here, move

00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:21.160
faster for free. To have people misunderstand
it and say all these bad things about it,

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.960
that were just you know knee-jerk reactions
without actually having taken time to think

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:30.130
about it, can only.. Must have felt very bad.
Especially because both Jordan and Tom had

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.600
already gone through all this internally in
Facebook for two years. But inside in Facebook

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.930
it's a smaller scale you can just get in a
meeting room and talk about it but you can't

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:41.690
really do that with the whole world can you.
There were some technical decisions that were

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:49.230
made as part of React that were self-evident
within Facebook but were like crazy when given

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:53.550
to a different audience in the community.
There was this notion of separation of concerns.

00:40:53.550 --> 00:41:01.700
At the time you shouldn't put your HTML, CSS
and JavaScript into the same file. You should

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:06.550
really extract them out and you should have
this separation. And so this was like very

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:12.620
like the best practice at the time. What was
interesting about the approach to separation

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.810
of concerns in React is that you separate
your concerns into different components. So

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:22.060
rather than saying: I have my view concerns
over here and my model concerns over here,

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:26.910
you say you have your newsfeed concerns over
here, your photo concerns over here, your

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:31.040
admin panel concerns over here. So it's a
different way of separating concerns and so

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:35.750
there was a lot of backlash around like oh
those people at Facebook are clowns, they

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:40.330
don't know how to write software. We thought
that React probably had no future outside

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:40.974
of Facebook.

00:41:40.974 --> 00:41:52.362
[Music]

00:41:52.362 --> 00:41:59.000
It looked like all hope was lost for our friends
at the Facebook office. But fortunately someone

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.444
outside of Facebook was willing to give it
a chance.

00:42:02.888 --> 00:42:11.520
[Music]

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:18.069
When I first started using React in 2013, it was not
popular in the community. It had just been

00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:20.313
announced at JSconf.

00:42:20.924 --> 00:42:27.273
I saw the announcement
post on Hacker News and immediately thought

00:42:27.273 --> 00:42:32.578
that it would be helpful for one of the projects
that I was working on at the time. I was building

00:42:32.578 --> 00:42:38.498
an interactive math question editor at Khan
Academy and it was something that had a very

00:42:38.498 --> 00:42:44.998
component oriented architecture. I was trying
to use Backbone.js at the time and found that

00:42:44.998 --> 00:42:49.578
the state management was getting a little
bit hard and when I looked at React I thought

00:42:49.578 --> 00:42:55.338
to myself, wow this actually looks like it
solves a lot of the problems that I have right now.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:05.380
I'm looking at this post from 2013 that I
guess I wrote a week after I learned about

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:13.339
React and it was right after I had started
trying to use it and somebody had asked "how

00:43:13.339 --> 00:43:20.948
is Facebook's React JavaScript library". And
I was a few days into using it and so I decided

00:43:20.948 --> 00:43:25.337
to write an answer to that question based
on my experience.

00:43:27.336 --> 00:43:30.000
The answer I wrote is very

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.810
positive. I think I was having a really good
time using it and it was solving my needs

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:43.240
really well. One line from the post says,
I just rewrote a 2000 line project in React

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:47.609
and have now made a handful of pull requests
to React. Everything about React I've seen

00:43:47.609 --> 00:43:53.040
so far seems really well thought out and I
am proud to be the first non-facebook production

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:59.750
user of React. And I talked a little bit more
about some of the technical details and how

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:05.200
it was helping me. It's cool to look back
and it's almost a bit of a time capsule to

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:14.530
see how even one week into React being released,
I was already pretty excited about it and

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:20.079
I think that excitement lasted for a long
time. I converted my entire code base that

00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:24.920
I was working on at the time over to React.
I think it ended up being less code and it

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:30.460
was easier to understand and it was faster.
Pretty quickly I said "okay I want to keep

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:38.170
using React" and I ended up deploying that
to production, my rewritten code, and that

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:42.987
was I think the first production code using
React outside of Facebook.

00:44:48.987 --> 00:44:53.246
It was a brand new project that had just been
open sourced and not many people had used

00:44:53.246 --> 00:44:58.286
it before, and so there were a bunch of rough
edges. It seemed like maybe nobody had tried

00:44:58.286 --> 00:45:02.847
to use it in a particular way before. Or if
something just wasn't documented well enough

00:45:02.847 --> 00:45:07.657
and I was trying to use it a slightly different
way than it was intended I ran into these

00:45:07.657 --> 00:45:13.647
little bugs or issues where it didn't work
quite as I was expecting it to. For some of

00:45:13.647 --> 00:45:18.847
those I read through the source code and tried
to figure out: okay why isn't this working,

00:45:18.847 --> 00:45:26.107
is there anything that I can be doing differently
for other cases? I ended up joining the IRC

00:45:26.107 --> 00:45:32.327
chat channel where a lot of the core team
members were hanging out after it had been

00:45:32.327 --> 00:45:40.048
open sourced. They helped me get started not
just using React but also starting to contribute

00:45:40.048 --> 00:45:45.537
to it as I started filing issues and helping
other people who were in that chat room, as

00:45:45.537 --> 00:45:51.928
well as starting to make small code changes
and starting to improve React over time.

00:45:52.428 --> 00:45:59.559
Her perspective from Khan Academy and just being
outside of Facebook was so valuable, so helpful!

00:45:59.559 --> 00:46:05.280
Sophie started as someone using React externally
then sort of like moved on to being someone

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:11.069
who contributed to React core externally then
became the most significant contributor to

00:46:11.069 --> 00:46:17.119
React core then we would have these like weekly
team meetings and invite Sophie to come and

00:46:17.119 --> 00:46:22.410
so Sophie like worked out with her local manager
at her company to like carve out Friday afternoons

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:28.700
to come to Facebook and hang out with us.
And so determined not to do what we had done

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:34.001
previously where we hired folks from the open
source community and then they never contributed

00:46:34.001 --> 00:46:42.063
anything back, she became the first ever open
source recruited member of the team.

00:46:44.174 --> 00:46:48.940
Sophie's involvement lifted the spirits of
the React team. It also got them thinking

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:56.930
that maybe, just maybe, the rest of the ecosystem
had dismissed React unfairly. They had something

00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:02.419
special, they knew it. What they didn't know
was how to convince everyone else.

00:47:02.419 --> 00:47:10.869
I think there are people on the team like me and Jordan
and Tom and Chedeau who like the challenge

00:47:10.869 --> 00:47:17.390
and the competitive nature of it. We knew
that this was good technology and I was so

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:25.450
sure of that, I viewed it as just a a messaging
problem, you know, okay we gotta crack how

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:30.000
we message this to people because they don't
get it and we have to figure out how to bring them there.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.790
The open source feels like a milestone
and it feels like this is the end. But in

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:39.760
practice it is just the beginning. Because
when you open source you actually have zero

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:45.320
users, now you need to actually build a community,
get all of the bugs fixed, make sure it actually

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:50.980
solves the use case for the people. And so
this is like when the journey begins. We buckled

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:58.190
down. And we also realized I think that really
when you have a project like this that's um

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:03.978
different you have to convince people one
by one. So I think that's really what we focused on.

00:48:04.422 --> 00:48:10.859
And we learned a lot doing that. We learned
that the ideas in React are solid, but really

00:48:10.859 --> 00:48:14.790
the ideas are not what people encounter when
they adopt a framework. What they encounter

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:20.280
are the docs and the error messages. What
they need more than anything else when they

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.138
adopt something is an incremental way of doing that.

00:48:23.747 --> 00:48:26.030
So the team got to work. They focused

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:31.120
on spreading the knowledge of React one concept
at a time, one person at a time.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:35.065
Then an opportunity arose: another conference.

00:48:35.962 --> 00:48:41.560
Later the same year, thank goodness,
Pete gave a talk at JSconf EU.

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:46.020
I had my desk over by the product
infrastructure team. I was sitting next to

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:53.280
Tomo and he's like, oh we're just like sponsoring
this JSconf EU conference and we have to give

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.970
a keynote and I don't want to give it. Because
I think he was like he didn't want to go through

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:01.470
all that stuff. Because you know after you
give the talk like people go and yell at you

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:06.359
after you get off stage and when you go to
the happy hour and stuff. It's not the most

00:49:06.359 --> 00:49:11.109
pleasant thing in the world. And I was like,
I'll do it! I'll take the free trip to Berlin

00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:16.970
and go give a talk at a conference. Hey I'm
Pete, I'm gonna talk to you about a library

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:23.630
for creating user interfaces that we call
React. We open sourced this at JSconf US a

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:28.880
couple months ago. And we got some kind of
sarcastic responses on Twitter, a little bit

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:34.930
of snickering, that kind of thing. We weren't
really communicating what we were doing so

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:39.980
I'd like to talk to you today about the design
decisions around React, what we're doing differently

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:45.404
than other Frameworks and kind of the implementation
that lets us make these decisions and make them really fast.

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.079
For this talk it was like,
here's what makes React different.

00:49:49.079 --> 00:49:52.839
I'm not even trying to say it's good, I'm not even
trying to say you should use it, I'm trying

00:49:52.839 --> 00:49:56.780
to say that this is interesting and there's
a lot of interesting stuff about how this

00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:03.319
thing works that you should pay attention
to. And that really resonated with people.

00:50:03.319 --> 00:50:07.350
And so we got these kind of early innovators
you know if you think of the crossing the

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:13.150
chasm diagram, where you've got your your
early adopters and then you've got your laggards

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:17.700
and in the middle you have your kind of normal
companies. That talk really got those early

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:23.160
adopters fired up and evangelizing React inside
of their own companies. After Pete's talk,

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:26.311
interest started to pick up. People started
paying attention. They just wanted to, you

00:50:26.311 --> 00:50:31.530
know, let me just see if there's something
there. And so we got this kind of like slow

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:36.230
burn of adoption of React. And it prompted
some really interesting conversations. It

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:41.230
recruited Brandon Bloom into the community
who came from the functional programming world,

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:46.870
somewhere. He started talking to his friends
and said, hey I think this React thing is

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:51.099
actually worth paying attention to. And then
he goes and talks to his friend David Nolen

00:50:51.099 --> 00:50:58.150
who is this very well known, very well respected,
really great musician and JavaScript developer.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:03.040
I think he was working at the New York Times
at the time and I was passing through New

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:10.710
York to do something and we grabbed coffee.
And I asked Pete some questions and Brandon

00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:16.890
Bloom, that was my friend that said you should
really look at React. And the reason I was

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:21.160
excited about it, more than I think you could
have been if you were JavaScript developer,

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:25.119
JavaScript is kind of multi-paradigm you can
do object oriented you can do functional if

00:51:25.119 --> 00:51:31.980
you want but it's not required but in Clojure
and ClojureScript functional is the most idiomatic

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:37.349
thing and nothing existed. Like we were sort
of like always trying to get things to work

00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:39.110
but it always felt like there was friction.

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.730
I was still early in my career right and this

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:48.040
is like really senior super smart engineer
and it was the type of thing where he would

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:53.109
ask me questions about it and I would stumble
to explain it and I would explain it poorly

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:58.930
and then he would repeat it back to me in
like a super eloquent great way and I was

00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:04.520
like yes, I'm gonna steal that! And so when
I sat with Brandon and Pete it was like this

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:11.430
huge light bulb went off, I was like: finally
this is so random, Facebook made this functional

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:18.700
UI framework. Eureka! I mean it was definitely
a eureka moment. It it did allow ClojureScript

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:25.020
programmers to finally write a reasonably
performant functional UIs. And it was very

00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:27.467
natural, it was a very, very good fit.

00:52:27.467 --> 00:52:29.435
Like a week or two later he wrote this blog post

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:34.363
called the Future of JavaScript MVCs that
just like changed the trajectory of the project.

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:39.849
In many ways you look at React and you're
like there's no way this could be fast, there's

00:52:39.849 --> 00:52:46.122
no way it could be efficient. And then I showed
these diagrams of what Backbone and React/Om

00:52:46.122 --> 00:52:52.119
look like and React is much better. Especially
when you're using persistent data structures.

00:52:52.119 --> 00:52:59.570
So my article I think was focusing purely
on the technical benefits of the design. It

00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:05.109
removed the superficial consideration and
I think people started saying, okay I will

00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:12.109
try it. Not I'm going to use it but it removed
that "I'm never going to use that" to "oh

00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:17.660
I'll give it a shot, this is interesting".
Once that post came out like within three

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:21.690
months after that I would say that we were
one of the big contenders if you were picking

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:22.830
a JavaScript framework.

00:53:23.386 --> 00:53:25.294
If you want to spread
an idea you need to really convince a few

00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:31.731
people and have those people share your message,
you can't just be shouting it yourself.

00:53:31.731 --> 00:53:40.750
More people started to realize that React had some
good ideas and made UI development simpler

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:47.010
in a lot of ways. Over the course of the next
I would say like year or two, we're kind of

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:53.070
just tracking things like Google Alerts of
how many times is it being mentioned, who's

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:58.420
writing about it, what projects are cropping
up. Because React was very unopinionated about

00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:04.559
a lot of stuff that you need in order to build
a front-end web application and you know people

00:54:04.559 --> 00:54:08.790
would fill in the blanks. And there was a
bunch of state management libraries that cropped

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:13.590
up and there was a bunch of router libraries
that cropped up and server-side rendering

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:18.836
strategies. And so there was this sort of
slow burn of adoption over the next year or two.

00:54:18.836 --> 00:54:24.040
React is a small focused UI library but
it proved capable when tackling Facebook's

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:30.840
hardest problems and other big companies noticed.
But there was one company especially eager

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.546
to rethink best practices.

00:54:33.546 --> 00:54:46.880
[Music]

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:51.729
We first heard about React back in 2014. The
Netflix website had been built using Java Web.

00:54:51.729 --> 00:54:57.380
It was very slow, it took about 15 minutes
to get up a build and we decided to move to

00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:03.160
a more modern framework. There we go. Now
at the time we weren't quite sure if you know

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:07.240
this React thing was going to work out. It
was kind of new and so we were very apprehensive,

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:12.530
especially since we were building the future
of the next 10 years of the website, right,

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:18.030
we make a bad choice now we got to backtrack
years worth of work. And so we were very careful

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:22.670
about not jumping into something that was
too bleeding edge. And so what they did was

00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:26.869
they actually pitted two teams against each
other. Each was given 30 days to build a prototype

00:55:26.869 --> 00:55:31.986
with one being React and the other one being
Backbone and after 30 days the choice was clear.

00:55:34.819 --> 00:55:37.950
So thank you all for coming out tonight. We're
really excited to have you here and share

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:42.220
the learnings that we've had, building the
new UI in React for the past year. It was

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:46.580
not this stage, it was our next stage over,
where I gave my React presentation back I

00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:53.220
guess in 2015. Same feeling like oh my goodness
I've got to convince all these people that

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:56.890
React is amazing.

00:55:56.890 --> 00:56:01.390
But I guess it worked. So I was part of the
team that built the new site using React.

00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:05.820
At first it was very clunky, like you're writing
components and they're not quite, you know,

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:10.450
you're putting too much logic into them or
you're thinking too big. It's not clear the

00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:14.100
difference in the paradigm. And then you start
to use it and you go okay wait wait wait I'm

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:19.579
thinking much more atomic. Hence the symbol
of react. I'm thinking about this individual

00:56:19.579 --> 00:56:23.450
reusability, okay now I'm thinking about the
testability of these components, I'm seeing

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:27.830
the benefits now come out of it. I can reuse
this over here, we can test this over here,

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:32.460
we can change this here, we can add props
in here. And it becomes very exciting to see

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:37.120
that new paradigm come to play and go: this
is going to be revolutionary, this is going

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:41.180
to change the world. Let's go back in time
one year to the old Netflix UI, you guys might

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:45.690
remember this one. The overall look and feel
is kind of like this old DVD kind of box art

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:49.850
feel and so I actually want to show you one
of the early prototypes of what we thought

00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:55.960
the new UI would look like. We knew that going
forward the world was changing, web was changing,

00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:00.059
things were moving faster, and our competition
was moving faster as well. So choosing React

00:57:00.059 --> 00:57:04.260
and going with a more modern framework really
helped us accelerate how fast we could build

00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:08.089
the website, how fast we could get new changes
out the door, how fast we could try improvements

00:57:08.089 --> 00:57:13.619
for our customers to make the best possible
experience.

00:57:13.619 --> 00:57:18.240
And because of that we've been at the forefront
of leading what UI design looks like in terms

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:23.720
of web development. We've had a lot of companies
copy us, which we take is a great compliment,

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:27.750
but we were there first because of react and
its ability to move so quickly in terms of

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:33.170
design. This is how it ended up turning out
and this is a UI that's big and immersive

00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:36.225
and completely built in React. So we're very
very proud of it and the result.

00:57:36.225 --> 00:57:42.138
[Music]

00:57:42.138 --> 00:57:47.804
Netflix was now praising React publicly and with a
second big company betting big on React,

00:57:47.804 --> 00:57:54.740
the framework grew in popularity. In fact it kind
of took on a life of its own and the community

00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:56.993
started to take off.

00:57:56.993 --> 00:58:08.160
[Music]

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:11.932
React at this point was getting more
popular

00:58:11.932 --> 00:58:17.145
and somebody on Twitter mentioned "hey it would be cool to have a React conference"

00:58:17.145 --> 00:58:19.820
and a lot of people started commenting and

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:24.770
tweeting about this. And I went to my manager
Tom Occhino. And he was like: there's like

00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:31.020
50 tweets about React today, like people are
talking about organizing conferences, should

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:34.200
we organize a conference? And I was like,
I don't know what that means, I don't know

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:38.680
how to do that, but like maybe. I was very
opposed to doing a conference. I thought it

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:47.079
was very cool that we got so much traction
without really pouring marketing money into it.

00:58:47.079 --> 00:58:51.920
Even though React came from big tech company
juggernaut Facebook, it was a small group

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:56.099
of people that were like really dedicated
to seeing this thing succeed, so it felt like

00:58:56.099 --> 00:59:03.079
this very indie you know Rebel Alliance type
of project. And so I was like we don't need

00:59:03.079 --> 00:59:07.869
a user conference, like we got this cool vibe
going on, let's see how far we can push it.

00:59:07.869 --> 00:59:09.202
I was totally wrong.

00:59:09.202 --> 00:59:12.630
We had said to ourselves,
I think it would be fun to host a React conference

00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:18.210
but are there even enough people using React
who would want to go to that, and eventually

00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:22.959
we decided: Well let's try it, let's try to
host the conference, and see how it goes.

00:59:24.237 --> 00:59:30.390
Within a minute, all of the tickets were sold
out and we actually crashed the website that

00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:34.349
were handling the actual payment system.

00:59:36.737 --> 00:59:42.559
Schrep, the CTO of Facebook, actually reached
out to me saying like: hey I have this very

00:59:42.559 --> 00:59:48.630
important like VP or CTO of some company that
wants in that couldn't get in. Like hey can

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:56.010
you do us a favor and I was like I would love
to, it's the CTO and everything, but like

00:59:56.010 --> 01:00:00.900
you know we're completely booked. Certainly
we were very surprised about how quickly the

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:05.740
tickets had sold out. We didn't realize just
how much the React ecosystem had grown and

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:10.302
just how much enthusiasm had been created
by early adopters.

01:00:12.618 --> 01:00:23.690
[Music]

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:26.780
We put it together pretty quickly as far as

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:31.910
conference planning goes and we just had it
on campus in one of our cafes and we bussed

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:38.349
people from the nearest hotel. And it was
very, very under produced but it worked out

01:00:38.349 --> 01:00:40.120
really, really well.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.510
Good morning everyone
and welcome to React.js conf!

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:50.920
The conference went like extremely, extremely
well. As the organizer of the conference,

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:56.940
I'm so excited to be here. And we open sourced
a bunch of our projects like React Native

01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:00.930
and we started talking about GraphQL, about
Relay. And so yeah it was a massive success.

01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:09.230
There is this moment where you go and you
see the stage and there's a giant wood cut

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:15.940
out like logo of the React atom. And I was
like, my friend Maykel, the designer at Instagram,

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:19.750
drew that in front of me like in the middle
of the night before we were going to open

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:22.589
source this thing, because we needed a logo,
and I was like: Maykel just like throw something

01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:27.730
together real quick. And now it's this thing
that somebody has built a giant sign with

01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:32.230
this on it and there's something about the
physical impact of that, that's really cool.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:37.490
That was the moment when it dawned on me that
React was becoming something different, you know.

01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:43.350
So for a long time what React was to
me was a software project and the reason why

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:46.819
I wanted people to adopt it was because I
really thought it would make their software

01:01:46.819 --> 01:01:51.150
better and make their lives better and make
their on-call rotations better. There are

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:56.109
a lot of reasons why I thought it would help
them. After that conference what I realized

01:01:56.109 --> 01:02:00.619
is that React was becoming a community. There
were meetups that would happen the immediate

01:02:00.619 --> 01:02:04.880
next week that would have an expanded audience
that they could go deeper into some of the

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:09.440
things that were discussed was really, really
cool and a huge recognition for us that the

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:15.920
community was going to be an incredible part
of what would make React work and at that

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:21.132
point was definitely already a really important
part of what had gotten React to that point so far.

01:02:21.132 --> 01:02:24.048
[Music]

01:02:24.048 --> 01:02:28.640
It's proven to me that engaging
with your open source community is actually

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:32.650
more important than the technical work itself,
like if you don't have a community you don't

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:37.079
have an open source project. I'm excited that
we just continue rethinking best practices.

01:02:37.079 --> 01:02:40.799
I want to thank this community for making
it possible for us to keep investing in this

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:44.468
and keep working on it. That's all I got,
thanks.

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:52.720
It was a real high point for, not just for
me but for the team, and you know I think

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:59.681
for Facebook engineering. I think we really
felt like not just validated but like we were

01:02:59.681 --> 01:03:05.230
actually like doing something that people
cared about and it was a really, really good

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:10.320
feeling. It was already like more widely used
within the company but now it was like, okay

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:15.661
how do we actually start converting everything
to React, how do we remove and deprecate all

01:03:15.661 --> 01:03:21.561
of the other frameworks and really like double
down on React. Oh hey, how is it going? Going

01:03:21.561 --> 01:03:27.440
from like an interesting product to this is
the next big thing. So it was a really amazing

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:33.599
time to be around and to get the whole company
working together as one, you know, to make

01:03:33.599 --> 01:03:34.746
this happen.

01:03:36.912 --> 01:03:41.575
Let's see, I have some keepsakes up here,

01:03:41.575 --> 01:03:46.830
which will be not easy for me to get down

01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:48.700
but.. Let's see.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:56.740
I have some stickers, oh this is a fun one,
this is the first ever React die cut sticker.

01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:01.329
We ordered like a bunch of these and put them
on our laptops and I never wanted to use the

01:04:01.329 --> 01:04:07.970
last one that I had. Facebook open source
stickers. Oh some of these will be a trip

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:15.160
down memory lane for folks. React conf. We
made you know, 2018 Facebook open source it's

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:23.630
a good one. React conf attendee badge. This
was a book from the original React.js conf

01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:30.940
at Facebook's headquarters so this had a list
of the speakers and the schedule and um here's

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:39.110
the keynote. Me and Christopher Chedeau. We
had all sorts of swag made and a bunch of

01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:45.329
other stuff.. So pretty good stuff, pretty
good memories.

01:04:45.329 --> 01:04:51.819
The team became inundated with questions from
the community and a new developer enters React's

01:04:51.819 --> 01:04:53.080
orbit.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:05:12.201
[Music]

01:05:12.201 --> 01:05:20.059
What should I do with my hands?
So you're saying that I should actually uh

01:05:20.059 --> 01:05:25.901
start like uh.. Let me focus for a second.
Just for the record, I did not create React,

01:05:25.901 --> 01:05:28.252
React was created by Jordan Walke.

01:05:29.752 --> 01:05:33.627
I worked at a small startup. We were creating a sort

01:05:33.627 --> 01:05:38.940
of a digital publishing platform so there
was a really complex post editor with different

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:43.930
blocks or like a scrollable text with like
different effects and stuff. And so creating

01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:50.030
a dynamic kind of interactive editor for for
these things was really difficult. And were

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:53.700
doing it with Backbone. I kind of wanted to
give React a try because it was supposed to

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:59.180
solve this problem. The first React component
I wrote was a like button so it was just like

01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:05.309
a button you click it and it says like you
like this or you and somebody like this or

01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:11.020
you and like 40 others like this. So there
was a bit of like a split and logic, and then

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:18.900
the way you would express this in other Frameworks
at the time, you had to kind of manually watch

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:23.549
what's changed and update it. And in React
you could just say, if nobody liked this show

01:06:23.549 --> 01:06:28.359
this, if one person like this, show this,
otherwise show this and like it's a very natural

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:33.630
way to write this kind of code. And yeah I
just wrote that button and I was like yeah

01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:40.980
that looks good, ship it. And so we actually
rewrote the entire app in React over the course

01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:46.470
of like 9 months while still shipping new
features. So React sped up our development

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:51.270
so much that we were able to add new features
faster, at the same time as we were replacing

01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:55.529
old features, that's why I really kind of
fell in love with it.

01:06:57.918 --> 01:07:02.849
A lot of things didn't exist back then. Like
there was no such thing as a React ecosystem.

01:07:02.849 --> 01:07:08.400
So if you needed something, it didn't exist,
you'd have to write it. So like you'd have

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:13.260
to figure out how to do it because otherwise
you're not going to have a product, right.

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:18.099
So that's kind of what I did for a bunch of
things. One of those projects in particular

01:07:18.099 --> 01:07:23.023
was.. I just saw a big opportunity there.

01:07:24.078 --> 01:07:26.560
It was called React Hot Loader at the time.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:31.750
So I wanted to give a talk about that, but
somebody else had done a talk that mentioned

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:36.760
it earlier at React conf. A really clever
fellow called Dan Abramov figured this out

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:42.040
and he created the React Hot Loader. And I
felt that well then that just wouldn't be

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:46.210
interesting because people kind of already
saw it which in retrospect I don't think it

01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:50.359
would be true but that's how I saw it at the
time. So I wanted to kind of spice it up a

01:07:50.359 --> 01:07:55.960
little bit and I wanted to make a proof of
concept of a thing I saw in a Bret Victor

01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:02.200
demo that is often referred to as time traveling.
If you're designing something embedded in

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.630
time, you need to be able to control time,
you need to be able to see across time, otherwise

01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:11.390
you're designing blind. I didn't really know
how to do it but I thought that's a cool idea

01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:16.810
for a talk. So I'm gonna send the proposal
if the proposal is successful then I'll just

01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:20.540
figure it out. And it turned out that the
proposal was more successful than I thought

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:25.600
it would be and so I made a proof of concept
for that and that proof of concept became

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.928
known as Redux.

01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:33.270
So my talk is about developer
tools because React and Hot Loading and time

01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:39.960
travel these are all developer tools. He was
literally creating Redux in service of being

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:44.850
able to deliver this talk and I called it
presentation driven development because the

01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:49.541
thing that shook out of it was you know this
sort of like canonical state management library

01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:54.750
for React apps for several years. Most of
my work is around the React ecosystem because

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:59.770
that's what inspired me to contribute to the
open source in the first place, but there

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:06.120
are two particular projects that I'm going
to talk about today. It was very validating

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:14.850
to give that talk but I was not surprised
by the response because well I had my doubts

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:21.720
but also I thought the talk was good.. like
I thought it's a really good talk. And I was

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:27.250
glad that people also liked it but I think
it was actually not the talk that was really

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:30.080
like the moment for me. I think it was just
like being there.

01:09:31.802 --> 01:09:33.350
It kind of felt like

01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:38.409
going to Hogwarts for the first
time. I think it kind of had this this feeling

01:09:38.409 --> 01:09:44.390
because there were all these people who I
only knew them as these avatars and when you

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:48.870
meet somebody in person they kind of become
three-dimensional of course. You kind of see

01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:53.739
the whole picture. And I think it was just
like such a wholesome feeling. It's the feeling

01:09:53.739 --> 01:09:58.870
that we are all trying to figure out what
we can do with this thing and we don't know

01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:01.429
it yet and we're just playing with it.

01:10:05.929 --> 01:10:11.850
That's also where I met Jing Chen. I had asked
for her advice before because she's one of

01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:17.400
the co-creators of the Flux architecture.
So it was nice to meet her in person and she

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:23.390
mentioned that actually Facebook is hiring
in London. And so they arranged an interview

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:27.429
for me right at the conference which was like
our normal interview process the same I think

01:10:27.429 --> 01:10:31.989
like four interviews or something like this
but I missed the second day of the conference

01:10:31.989 --> 01:10:37.100
but we just did an interview there and so
that's kind of how I got into Facebook. We

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:43.120
just quickly grabbed them out of the conference
a little bit like on the down low and then

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:48.533
conducted the interviews in the basement of
a hotel I think.

01:10:50.699 --> 01:10:54.032
No Dan is special, he's always been a little
special.

01:10:54.032 --> 01:10:55.580
I guess like I would think of myself

01:10:55.580 --> 01:11:02.520
as like maybe the first member of what would
become the React team as you know it today

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:08.989
because I joined a little bit earlier than
I think Andrew, Brian, Luna and and like a

01:11:08.989 --> 01:11:14.219
bunch of other people who work with us now.
And I joined at the time when a few people

01:11:14.219 --> 01:11:19.969
who worked with us before were just about
to leave. So I was kind of in this transitional

01:11:19.969 --> 01:11:22.647
period when the team was changing a lot.

01:11:22.647 --> 01:11:30.700
[Music]

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:32.200
Remember the old days?

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.950
Do you remember the first time you
met Andrew?

01:11:35.728 --> 01:11:40.053
Uh I think I've met.. I do! I think

01:11:40.053 --> 01:11:43.739
I met him yeah.. I thought it was at React
conf. Well that was the clear moment, maybe,

01:11:43.739 --> 01:11:49.181
was that the first time? Did you get invited
to React conf because of that.. He had a speech.

01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:56.729
I met him like I think before that. I met
you and Sophie and Joe and Tim like all in

01:11:56.729 --> 01:12:01.580
the same week. Yeah he started asking some
questions that were very similar to the questions

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:06.159
that on the team we were talking about internally
and so I just remember like, I gotta connect

01:12:06.159 --> 01:12:09.580
you with like Sebastian and Jordan and the
rest of the team. Yeah and then also I was

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:13.810
like to the recruiters I was like yeah this
guy like we gotta hire this Andrew guy. And

01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:17.540
I think we were really fortunate early on
to have a bunch of people that kind of stepped

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:22.064
up and they were this seems cool, I just want
to be a part of this, I just want to help.

01:12:22.064 --> 01:12:26.460
I didn't realize it was kind of like a freshman
class sort of feeling at the time. Sophie

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:31.280
had started managing the team around that
time as well and I couldn't have really asked

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:38.739
for a better both project and set of colleagues
and team to join. The beginning of phase two.

01:12:38.739 --> 01:12:41.822
Yeah, that's cool.

01:12:42.544 --> 01:12:47.730
Awesome! I feel
like we really brought it home there at the end.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.170
Like man we're nailing this!

01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:58.497
[Music]

01:12:58.497 --> 01:13:01.600
React was now out of the hands of
its founders.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:08.255
It was ready to take on new life in the care of a
new community grown and future-minded team.

01:13:08.255 --> 01:13:12.559
We tried to watch some of the numbers like the number of GitHub stars

01:13:12.559 --> 01:13:15.660
or the number of npm downloads. On Google

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:21.690
Trends, how many people are searching for
React and none of those numbers are perfect

01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:29.340
but basically all of them kept going up over
time and eventually got to a point where we

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:35.810
looked at it and said oh yeah like millions
of people essentially are using React.

01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:43.090
There are a lot of little details in how we did
things that encourages an ecosystem to participate,

01:13:43.090 --> 01:13:49.060
that were critical parts in making it what
it is today. We didn't put everything in the

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:54.389
framework. We left a lot of it to the ecosystem
to innovate. And we got a lot of contributions,

01:13:54.389 --> 01:14:01.239
we got a lot of interest that way, we got
a lot of things spurring from that. It was

01:14:01.239 --> 01:14:07.679
not ever a foregone conclusion. Like it's
still surreal to me that it's as popular as

01:14:07.679 --> 01:14:13.550
it is. It's this great example of this like
underdog technology within a big company where

01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:18.040
there could have been these forces that really
pushed back on it. I think a lot of elements

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:24.310
of good timing, good fortune, good luck, good
leadership support, all sort of like aggregated

01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:31.740
to allow React to be a success, that had we
missed a few of those or had a handful more

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:36.550
things failed instead of succeeded, then I
do not think React would be in the spot that

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:42.840
it is today. I feel like you can't take anyone
out of it and have it be what it became. I

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.550
think in the early days obviously Jordan,
right. Like this thing wouldn't exist. And

01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:51.560
then Jing Chen just absolutely critical. I
mean she was so instrumental in the early

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:56.070
days of React that it just wouldn't have been
a thing that we cared about if it didn't prove

01:14:56.070 --> 01:15:03.449
itself. And then Shane O'Sullivan is responsible
for you know really I mean a very hard decision

01:15:03.449 --> 01:15:07.770
to like I'm gonna go this path instead of
that thing. And then the engineers that worked

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:12.000
on refining and iterating on it and turning
it into something good it was Chedeau and

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.600
Paul O'Shannessy and Pete Hunt. And my manager
Adam Wolff, when I was like you know asking

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:20.860
all these questions about like should we be
doing, like is this even worth it, especially

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:24.780
after JS conf when we were feeling defeated,
you know, he was there to pick me back up

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:29.520
and be like: no look it is delivering value,
this is good, keep going. And there's different

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:34.150
phases too right, you have the early, early
days and you had the like for the next literally

01:15:34.150 --> 01:15:40.300
almost we're going on 10 years now, with Sebastian's
technical leadership and Andrew and Dan and

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:46.830
Dominic and Flarney and Sophie and I just
feel like it's just a group of incredible

01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:53.150
people and if you take any of them out of
it it just looks pretty different. It was

01:15:53.150 --> 01:15:58.870
really a team effort, it was really a team
effort from the very beginning.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:06.078

Misko Hevery says that awesome solutions
are rarely created by large organizations.

01:16:12.679 --> 01:16:19.280
It's almost always one person with passion
and vision that slowly start to infect others.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:25.370
This is a great summary of how React became
React. Because it was never inevitable, it

01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:31.600
was always this wild idea that kept gathering
momentum, person by person. And many expected

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:37.880
React to fail and if it weren't for the hard
work of a few determined developers

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.840
it very well could have.

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:48.639
This is just the beginning of the React story.
The story of how a community transformed an

01:16:48.639 --> 01:16:53.977
underdog UI library into the most popular
JavaScript framework today.

It's just really strange to think that you're just
so close to death.
